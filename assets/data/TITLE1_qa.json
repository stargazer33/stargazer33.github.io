(Want to see how we did? The links above highlight some of our work). And that’s not even including our family of WordPress plugins led by The Events Calendar.</div><div><br></div><div>We’ve got a slew of cool projects we are working on in 2018, and need another member for our QA team. If working on high-profile sites for large clients gets you excited and a serious case of attention to detail is your jam, we should talk</div><div><br></div><div><h2>Responsibilities</h2></div><div>QA is responsible for ensuring all aspects of quality at Modern Tribe. It’s a tall order for sure: learning how a site works, creating test plans covering obscure use cases, and then putting it all into practice when testing every aspect of site functionality…it’s a lot of ground to cover. But we’ve got an established workflow down that helps make sure we’re setting the team up with the tools they need to proceed and succeed.</div><div><br></div><div>Though every project is different, here’s the gist of our QA flow:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>KICKOFF MEETING.&nbsp;</span>Just a kickoff — meet the PM; get your questions answered; set expectations; and schedule milestones.</li><li><span>PREPARING DOCS.&nbsp;</span>Getting started with internal documentation early is hugely important to getting the project into your brain.</li><li><span>REVIEW APPROVED COMPS.&nbsp;</span>Before you start QA or even get a walkthrough, you’ll review the comps to understand the project + prepare a list of questions to ask on the QA walkthrough.</li><li><span>QA WALKTHROUGH.&nbsp;</span>Once development is far enough along for QA to begin, you’ll do a walkthrough with the lead developer to get an overview of the functionality.</li><li><span>PREPARE QA CHECKLIST + TEST PLAN.&nbsp;</span>After seeing each component of the site in action, you’ll put together a first draft at a comprehensive QA checklist and a higher-level overview of what you’re planning to test, in what order, and when.</li><li><span>HEAVY DUTY TESTING.&nbsp;</span>You’ll put the site through its paces and give it a few rounds of full pass bug hunting. Beyond just hitting buttons, you’ll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what we’re doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><span>CELEBRATING A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH.&nbsp;</span>What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and — most importantly — the client will be happy. It doesn’t get much better than that.</li></ul><div>* Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.</div><div><br></div><div><h2><span>Personal Competencies</span></h2></div><ul><li>Strong communication and/or experience working as part of a remote team</li><li>Self-motivated, detail-oriented, strong organizational skills, with a methodical approach to all tasks</li><li>Ability to prioritize workloads and meet deadlines</li><li>Ability to work independently with minimal oversight</li><li>Fluent English speaker</li></ul><div><h2><span>Required Knowledge &amp; Experience</span></h2></div><ul><li>Has a proven track record in Quality Assurance.</li><li>Pays meticulous attention to detail + fights for the customer. Being able to catch bugs is huge, but it isn’t everything — QA is most effective when it puts itself in the customer or end user’s shoes.</li><li>Knows WordPress well, you’ll be expected to prove your familiarity with the platform.</li><li>Excellent verbal, non-verbal and written communication skills</li><li>Has 1+ year remote freelancing experience.</li></ul><div><h2><span>Additional Experience (Bonus Points)</span></h2></div><ul><li>Familiarity setting up local WordPress environments + cloning GIT repositories locally</li><li>Skills at training others how to admin complex WordPress sites/projects</li><li>Experience writing and implementing automated testing processes</li></ul><div><h2><span>Location</span></h2></div><div>Work from anywhere in the US or Canada; if you are in Central or South America, let’s talk. This will be a 100% remote position. If your working hours are in a timezone outside of the US range, but you work 4+ hours of overlap each day our team might be able to consider your application.</div><div><br></div><div><h2>Compensation</h2></div><div>Our hourly rate for this gig starts at&nbsp;<span>$25-$35/hr</span>, depending on experience, with opportunities for rate bumps on annual review. This gig is about&nbsp;<span>8 hours</span>&nbsp;per week of work to start and ramping up to about 15 -20 hours over the next 2 -3 months. This is a one time contract position, though we are always seeking longer relationships with kick-ass people.</div><div><br></div><div><h2>Inclusion Statement</h2></div><div>Modern Tribe is committed to a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion. We foster an environment of collaboration, open engagement, fairness and respect regardless of differences in age, race, disability, national origin, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status. As a hybrid workspace ranging from distributed contractors to traditional employees, we value the unique perspectives and experiences of our global team.</div><div><br></div><div>We come from all walks of life.

We are travelers, feminists, runners, volunteers, and makers. We are a Modern Tribe.</div><div><br></div><div>Everyday we strive to fulfill our motto: live well and do good work. We hope you will consider joining us.</div><div><br></div><div><h2><span>Perks</span></h2></div><div>We believe in learning from each other and fostering personal growth.

This time, we're overhauling our desktop and mobile offerings and preparing to launch Lonely Planet into the 21st—nay, the 27th century. The ultimate goal is to create a kind of hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy for travelers: a way of accessing rich, powerful, and contextual information about people, places, and things, whether you're on your computer in SOMA or on your smartphone in Kandahar.</p><p>Based on that description, you may be tempted to say that we're building an encyclopedia. Not so fast. Instead of a general reference tool, we're building a targeted searchlight for road warriors, a cicerone for globetrotters, a traveling companion that quickly and intelligently reports on everything from popular phrases to wall outlets to lethal animals. Because you have better things to do than getting eaten by a Komodo dragon on your honeymoon. What you see right now—our current website and apps—are the preface to a much grander vision that we hope to implement in the very near future. To that end, we're hiring the best and brightest from all over the globe with the intention of forming a world-class technology team. In other words: don't think of us as a company that only prints books. We're a technology company, and we're pretty stoked about it.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexi-time</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>15 - 25 days</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Choose your own machine</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Conferences and training</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Casual work environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work alongside a talented, driven team</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

(Want to see how we did? The links above highlight some of our work). And that’s not even including our family of WordPress plugins led by The Events Calendar.</div><div><br></div><div>We’ve got a slew of cool projects we are working on in 2018, and need another member for our QA team. If working on high-profile sites for large clients gets you excited and a serious case of attention to detail is your jam, we should talk</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Responsibilities</h3></div><div>QA is responsible for ensuring all aspects of quality at Modern Tribe. It’s a tall order for sure: learning how a site works, creating test plans covering obscure use cases, and then putting it all into practice when testing every aspect of site functionality…it’s a lot of ground to cover. But we’ve got an established workflow down that helps make sure we’re setting the team up with the tools they need to proceed and succeed.</div><div><br></div><div>Though every project is different, here’s the gist of our QA flow:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>KICKOFF MEETING.&nbsp;</span>Just a kickoff — meet the PM; get your questions answered; set expectations; and schedule milestones.</li><li><span>PREPARING DOCS.&nbsp;</span>Getting started with internal documentation early is hugely important to getting the project into your brain.</li><li><span>REVIEW APPROVED COMPS.&nbsp;</span>Before you start QA or even get a walkthrough, you’ll review the comps to understand the project + prepare a list of questions to ask on the QA walkthrough.</li><li><span>QA WALKTHROUGH.&nbsp;</span>Once development is far enough along for QA to begin, you’ll do a walkthrough with the lead developer to get an overview of the functionality.</li><li><span>PREPARE QA CHECKLIST + TEST PLAN.&nbsp;</span>After seeing each component of the site in action, you’ll put together a first draft at a comprehensive QA checklist and a higher-level overview of what you’re planning to test, in what order, and when.</li><li><span>HEAVY DUTY TESTING.&nbsp;</span>You’ll put the site through its paces and give it a few rounds of full pass bug hunting. Beyond just hitting buttons, you’ll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what we’re doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><span>CELEBRATING A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH.&nbsp;</span>What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and — most importantly — the client will be happy. It doesn’t get much better than that.</li></ul><div>* Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.</div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>Personal Competencies</span></h3></div><ul><li>Strong communication and/or experience working as part of a remote team</li><li>Self-motivated, detail-oriented, strong organizational skills, with a methodical approach to all tasks</li><li>Ability to prioritize workloads and meet deadlines</li><li>Ability to work independently with minimal oversight</li><li>Fluent English speaker</li></ul><div><h3><span>Required Knowledge &amp; Experience</span></h3></div><ul><li>Has a proven track record in Quality Assurance.</li><li>Pays meticulous attention to detail + fights for the customer. Being able to catch bugs is huge, but it isn’t everything — QA is most effective when it puts itself in the customer or end user’s shoes.</li><li>Knows WordPress well, you’ll be expected to prove your familiarity with the platform.</li><li>Excellent verbal, non-verbal and written communication skills</li><li>Has 1+ year remote freelancing experience.</li></ul><div><h3><span>Additional Experience (Bonus Points)</span></h3></div><ul><li>Familiarity setting up local WordPress environments + cloning GIT repositories locally</li><li>Skills at training others how to admin complex WordPress sites/projects</li><li>Experience writing and implementing automated testing processes</li></ul><div><h3><span>Location</span></h3></div><div>Work from anywhere in the US or Canada; if you are in Central or South America, let’s talk. This will be a 100% remote position. If your working hours are in a timezone outside of the US range, but you work 4+ hours of overlap each day our team might be able to consider your application.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Compensation</h3></div><div>Our hourly rate for this gig starts at&nbsp;<span>$25-$35/hr</span>, depending on experience, with opportunities for rate bumps on annual review. This gig is about&nbsp;<span>8 hours</span>&nbsp;per week of work to start and ramping up to about 15 -20 hours over the next 2 -3 months. This is a one time contract position, though we are always seeking longer relationships with kick-ass people.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Inclusion Statement</h3></div><div>Modern Tribe is committed to a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion. We foster an environment of collaboration, open engagement, fairness and respect regardless of differences in age, race, disability, national origin, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status. As a hybrid workspace ranging from distributed contractors to traditional employees, we value the unique perspectives and experiences of our global team.</div><div><br></div><div>We come from all walks of life.

We are travelers, feminists, runners, volunteers, and makers. We are a Modern Tribe.</div><div><br></div><div>Everyday we strive to fulfill our motto: live well and do good work. We hope you will consider joining us.</div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>Perks</span></h3></div><div>We believe in learning from each other and fostering personal growth. You can expect to learn a lot while working with us and we have a benefits package for full time employees.</div><div><br></div><div>(Also, if you work enough with us, we’ll bring you on the&nbsp;<a href='https://vimeo.com/254214062' rel='nofollow'></a><a href='https://tri.be/blog/team-trip-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team trip</a>.)</div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>Who We Are</span></h3></div><div>Modern Tribe, Inc. is a rapidly growing software &amp; design company.

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><ol><li><strong>Customized Credit-Improvement Tips:</strong>&nbsp;WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</li><li><strong>Personalized Money-Saving Advice:</strong>&nbsp;WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</li><li><strong>Wallet Surveillance:</strong>&nbsp;Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</li></ol><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities include:</strong></p><ul><li>Testing and assuring high quality performance of website</li><li>Reporting and validating bugs for all components</li><li>Creating test plans and test cases</li><li>Identify opportunities for improvement and make constructive suggestions for change</li></ul><p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>At least 2 years experience in Test Automation with Java and Selenium</li><li>Excellent attention to details</li><li>Ability &amp; motivation to work a minimum of 50 hrs per week</li><li>Proven ability to meet deadlines and handle multiple tasks in a fast paced environment</li><li>Must stay up-to-date with developing technologies and showcase them in your work</li><li>Proficient in written/spoken English</li></ul><p>Note: This position does not have a location requirement and be performed remotely (outside the US) and requires an overlap with US ET business hours from Monday to Friday to facilitate working together with US team members.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/156020?reset=False&amp;ra=Qk6up1ny6Xu&amp;oqs=a%3DQk6up1ny6Xu' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Wallethub</h2>            <div><p>WalletHub helps all consumers reach top financial fitness by providing:<br><br>• Free credit scores and credit reports that are updated on a daily basis.<br><br>• Free 24/7 credit monitoring and personalized advice that will help you improve your credit and save money. <br><br>• More reviews on financial products, professionals and companies than any other website.<br><br>• An extensive education center coupled with the ability to ask financial experts your money-related questions for free .</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work visa sponsorship</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from home</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

If you haven't tested before, here are some key success factors:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>You read instructions and understand them. If the instructions say that something is out of scope and you test it, you’re wasting your own time.</li><li>You communicate precisely in English. Bug reporting is a particular form of communication that demands precision, concise wording, and logical ordering.</li><li>You are curious. The best testers aren’t robots who follow a script. They like things that seem mysterious. They deviate from the Happy Path. They like to experiment with apps.</li><li>You spot patterns. Similar bugs occur in unrelated software systems, so being able to sense patterns is very helpful.</li><li>You like games. There does seem to be a high degree of overlap between testers and gamers. Part of it is the thrill of the hunt, and the desire to understand the rules of a system and how to beat them.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>When you start as a tester at test IO, you'll get coaching from team leaders, then participate in test cycles with more experienced testers.
