We believe each member is equally valuable, and we treat them as such. We are looking for a top-notch back end Architect who can make the important tech choices, be hands-on in developing those choices, and grow a small engineering team to assist. Initially, you will be wearing many hats as is typical in the start-up realm.<br /><br />You will be responsible for the Architecture, Roadmap, and Development of the application. Please note we are open to various technology platforms. The person we are looking for has a vast back end mobile application development experience and can guide us on best practices. Slot gaming knowledge is a strong plus, but it’s not necessary if you’re willing to learn. You must also be strongly self-directed, good at managing timelines, and good at working independently and as a team member as this is very collaborative.<br /><br />Our offices are located in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles – Remote work is fine.<br /><br />The Tech Stack<br />You get to influence this! Currently, we're thinking the back end will be in Java. <br />We're also considering Go, Rust, Python, Node.js, or even C# - if you can make a strong case as to why being locked into the Microsoft infrastructure is preferable. Come to us with strong opinions and a willingness to discuss engineering trade-offs.<br /><br /><br />Experience we are looking for:<br /><br />    You must have worked on back end projects deployed for iOS, Android, and/or both.<br /><br />    We want someone who has developed a mobile app and has been on a small team. Show us that you’ve had ownership of some part of a program you’ve worked on.<br /><br />    Start-up experience is really nice to have. Gaming experience is a plus.<br /><br />    It'd be nice if you've led a team in the past, as this position has the opportunity to grow into a managerial role as we grow the company.<br /><br />    You must have sysadmin / operations experience and be able to set up infrastructure for the app, preferably in a cloud context - systems, network, monitoring, security, etc. <br /><br />We plan on making a number of build-or-buy decisions so experience with integrating third-party tools and/or services is a plus.<br /><br />    Also a huge plus: experience scaling a consumer-facing service, particularly with respect to tuning for performance and reliability."

Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is revolutionizing the customer experience at these restaurant chains, and we're looking for talented engineers to join our team and help achieve this vision.

    "content": "*Location:* London<br /><br />*About Spektrix*<br />--<br />At Spektrix, we believe that entertainment experiences – whether theatre, sports, music and many more – improve the world in which we live. Our mission is to help make more of those experiences happen by transforming the way entertainment organisations sell tickets and build relationships with their audiences.<br /><br />Spektrix has grown considerably over the past few years, growing from 100 clients in the UK to over 300 both in the UK and North America. We sell over 20m tickets through our B2B SaaS platform. And we’re only just getting started.<br /><br />We’re bringing new clients on to the Spektrix platform weekly. This involves live migrations of millions of ticket sales (past and future), customer records and fundraising activities from their legacy systems into Spektrix.  We have built a reputation of making this migration process as smooth as possible for our clients, so that they can carry on with “business as usual” from their first day on Spektrix.<br /><br />*The job*<br />--<br />We are looking for a data migration engineer to join our data migration team. You will be leading data migration projects end to end while working closely with the rest of the data, techOps and implementation teams.<br /><br />You’ll work collaboratively with all stakeholders, including clients and our business team, to balance the client’s needs with delivering the project on time. You will occasionally visit clients and understanding their requirements will be part of your responsibility.<br /><br />You will develop and maintain the data importer to deliver improvements, include new functionality, improve efficiency and keep data integrity. You’ll be taking ownership of existing tools, as well as building from scratch when we come across systems we’ve never migrated from before.<br /><br />You’ll need to quickly get your head around the foreign data sets you’re provided with and use your problem solving skills to work out how to transform these into the Spektrix format. <br /><br />Working with others in your team to find the best solution, often times with lots of opinions, but no egos.<br /><br />We work innovatively, seeking new ideas and sharing new insights from blogs, conferences, and ultimately learning from mistakes! We learn through regular development talk sessions, held every couple of weeks.<br /><br />The role includes supporting our New York implementation team and North American clients, so the role has potential to develop to include travel and a permanent move to the US office.<br /><br />*Some of the technologies we use*<br />--<br />Our system is a multi-tenant, scalable SaaS platform. For data migrations we use the following technologies:<br /><br />* C# console applications<br />* SQL Server<br />* Powershell<br />* Full Convert<br />* JIRA / Trello / Confluence / Google Apps<br />* Stash (Git) Source Control / Bitbucket / Bamboo<br /><br />*What we're looking for*<br />--<br />* You will have strong SQL skills, whether that is from SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL or Postgres. Preferably with experience migrating data between different systems, platforms and database schemas.<br />* You can quickly analyse, understand and translate between vastly different implementations of common concepts.<br />* You will enjoy running projects from inception to delivery. You believe the best way to serving clients is by getting close to them.<br />* You are a great communicator, able to  explain complex processes both verbally and in writing. You have experience writing process or specification documentation.<br />* You are comfortable working to deadlines and have the ability to prioritise your workload to meet changing circumstances. You are able to concisely and efficiently communicate project progress and risks. You know who are your key stakeholders and what information they need.<br />* You will have an interest in the wider technical community, looking for ways to learn new  approaches to tackling complex problems as well as sharing your own story."

People don’t approach Art+Logic to churn out routine apps; they come because they have something hard, often requiring research and skilled implementation.&nbsp;There is no better place than Art+Logic for software developers to do what they love — and also better hone their craft.</em>”</p><p><br>Job Type: 1099, rates ranging $35-$50/hour<br>Travel: None Required - Work from Home<br>Location: United States and Canada only</p><p><strong>Find out more at:</strong></p><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://plus.google.coj/+ArtAndLogic' rel='nofollow'>https://plus.google.com/+ArtAndLogic</a></li><li><a href='http://www.artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>http://www.artandlogic.com/careers/</a></li></ul></ul><p><strong>Have more questions?</strong>&nbsp;Email us at <a href='mailto:Recruiting@artandlogic.com' rel='nofollow'>Recruiting@artandlogic.com</a></p><p>Some things are best said multiple times. <strong>Please note&nbsp;your interest in this specific position, when applying.&nbsp;</strong>(You can do so&nbsp;in the &quot;Brag&quot; section.)</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual Conference</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "
