We're looking for a Design Manager to help manage and grow our Platform Design Team at Zapier. Are you excited to foster a user-centered design culture in 100% remote company? Then keep reading!</div><div><br></div><div><h2>About You</h2></div><div><b><span>You put your teammate's and customer's needs first.</span>&nbsp;</b>You enjoy helping and enabling designers do great work. You set design strategy by aligning business strategy and our user's needs. You use data and user research to make human-centered design decisions. You challenge assumptions about what makes a design successful through encouraging divergent exploration and talking to users.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You're technically inclined.</b></span>&nbsp;The Platform team is responsible for all of the apps on Zapier. Notably, we have over 1000 partners who create, test, launch, maintain, and improve apps on the Zapier platform – and add dozens every month. The Platform is unique inside Zapier. They have&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;users: the end-users who use the apps on Zapier and the developers/partners building the apps. Serving both users effectively requires getting to know some of the technical inner-workings to help your team design effective solutions.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>You wear many hats.</span>&nbsp;</b>You are constantly learning and leveling up your management skills. You have the relevant design skills to build rapport with the Design Team. On a regular basis you can expect to be holding one on ones with designers, thinking through tricky design problems, reviewing design iterations, and helping prioritize design needs across the company that align with our business strategy.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>You have experience hiring and managing UX Researchers and Designers.</span>&nbsp;</b>This isn't your first rodeo. You may not have hired or managed hundreds of people before, but you have hired, trained and managed before.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You love collaboration and feedback.</b></span>&nbsp;You understand successful design doesn't happen in a vacuum or in secret. You believe in sharing work early, openly, and often. You enjoy working closely with Product Managers, Engineers, Data Scientists, and Customers to help make the Design Team's designs achieve effective results.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You know how design impacts development.</b></span>&nbsp;You've built functional web apps before. You understand the technical complexities a design might introduce, and can work through them with your teammates. You don't believe in “tossing designs over the wall,” and would dread doing so.</div><div><br></div><div><h2>Things You Might Do</h2></div><div>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, your primary goal is to help achieve better design outcomes and here are some things you'll probably do:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Hold weekly one on ones with members of the Platform Design Team (Product Designers and UX Researchers).</li><li>Build rapport with each member of the Platform Design Team and work hard to help them level up their skills</li><li>Collaborate with platform leadership to understand business strategy and apply it to your team's work</li><li>Work to serve developers, product managers, and business development teams at our 1000+ partner organizations</li><li>Collaborate across functions to help set roadmaps that will achieve business goals through design</li><li>Advocate for and teach design skills across the organization. Find ways to involve non-designers in the design process through design sprints and other creative means</li><li>Help champion our Zapier design standards and visual identity</li><li>Provide feedback on design solutions through wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes</li><li>Participate in user research and other experiments to inform design decisions</li><li>Give, seek, and receive thoughtful critical feedback</li><li>Give back to the community via open source, blog posts, and&nbsp;<a href='https://dribbble.com/zapier?utm_source=zapier.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=zapier' rel='nofollow'>sharing design team work</a></li><li>Help recruit, onboard and train new Design Team members at Zapier</li><li>Help customers via All Hands Support to learn about Zapier and the product</li></ul><div><br></div>            </div><div>How to apply:<br><a href='https://zapier.workable.com/j/E51078ADCA' rel='nofollow'>zapier.workable.com/j/E51078ADCA</a></div>"

One that’s venture-backed and generating revenue<br /><br />This is for you if: <br />* People like you.

(Contribute to Dribbble, Github, or write blogs) <br />* You’re focused.

For this role, the range is $60k – $90k per year. <br />* Work remotely: Live and work from wherever you feel happiest. Receive a stipend to work at an office of your choice <br />* Learning & Development stipend: To encourage our teammates to be their best selves, we offer a small stipend for any course or training they’d like to do. <br />* Technology: $1,000 towards your company computer or at-home office furniture <br />* Retreats: Join us on quarterly company retreats! <br />* Vacation: Our only policy is that you give yourself a break regularly enough. For some, that's a couple days a month and for others, it's a few weeks a year. <br />* Health Insurance: We cover half of your Health Insurance starting your first day of full employment. <br />* Working Hours: Regardless of where you are in the world, as long as you’re online for our semi-monthly sprint meeting - you can work the hours of your choice.<br /><br />What would set you apart when applying is: <br />* Optimistic/Positive Energy/Communication <br />* Diligence in understanding our financial model (when we share it with you) and how our business works <br />* The desire to work really hard and build something <br />* Focus on being apart of an amazing team and building something great - not because you can travel or be remote (although it’s a huge perk!)<br /><br />Interested in joining our team?

    "content": "[ LONDON APPLICANTS ONLY]<br /><br />The time has come! At last a designer advert that isn't boring! But why?<br /><br />Well because at BoxSmart, we are a team of interesting people that aren't boring in the tech world! We are ENERGY.<br /><br /><br />I’m not just saying this. This is the last advert and INSPIRATIONAL, REAL and GREAT designers needs to see!<br /><br />We are seeking someone that can offer<br />Web design<br />ASP net and coding backend<br />HTML pages for our mailouts<br />and more things you can offer!<br /><br />[Who is writing this ENERGETIC email???]<br /><br />We are BoxSmart. A team of over 13 individuals that help small brands get better pricing for their packaging needs.<br /><br />We built Boxsmart to help talented people launch their brands and leave the filthy rat race that London has made these days. So you can get an idea of the type of people that run this ship – GIVERS.<br /><br /><br />This role is really to find the right PERSON. A ‘right person’ will work with the Martketing Director (nifty place to be if you influence them with your talents. Plenty of room in a startup to climb the ladder? Just a thought…).<br /><br />The ‘Right Person’ is a subjective thing but we know what it is. We can carve any intern to wherever they wish to go if you are like the ‘Right Person’ for BoxSmart. So here goes:<br /><br /><br />1- Someone that has a sense of PURPOSE. That doesn’t chase money (it comes as the byproduct of good work. We look after our family/team. We commit to everyone that works here are BoxSmart).<br /><br /><br />2- Someone that is simply fed up of the rat race. That is ‘boxed’ (excuse the pun) in a fixed role and can’t dip their finger in certain areas. Well we need someone flexible and up for trying new areas of the business – that way you can fall into a role you love later on within the team (see… we DO care)<br /><br /><br />3- A ‘giver’, not a taker: So many people take, take, take. Nobody gives first. Everyone at BoxSmart TRUSTS and gives first. Can you?<br /><br /><br />4- Someone highly creative. Lateral and charismatic. This is ESSENTIAL. We will know in the first TWO MINUTES on our phone chat – so you can’t hide!<br /><br /><br /><br />5- Someone that eventually wants to run their own business. I mean, why would a business not want to hire someone with those aspirations? Probably someone that wants you good enough to exploit but not good enough for you to leave right? Well at boxsmart we always offer other business ventures we build and aim for everyone to enjoy their lives by embracing GROWTH (we currently have three businesses we are building, alongside this. The right person is always welcome to take the reins. I mean, why not?? A good person deserves to grow).<br /><br /><br />6- Someone that has a LIFE TOO! This role is remote. You visit the CEO/Marketing once a week or so and work via phone. You have a life. Can pay your bills and work SMART. We don’t need someone imprisoned at a desk. We are over that. In fact we all work from home, coffee shops and have board meetings over dinners at nice restaurants! Why not? We are clever and we work in a remote generation.<br /><br /><br />The role:<br /><br /><br />This is the part where we tell you the core basics of the role:<br /><br /><br /><br />A – To support the Ceo/Marketing team in rebuiding the website and making the other sites to come<br /><br />B - To help with digital mediums for the BoxSmart departments: Exhibitions/PouchSmart and other spin offs that we are launching!<br /><br /><br />And that’s it! Just someone that wants to team up!<br /><br />[What do i get?]<br />Well we will pay you a 'case by case' amount, BUT we can also offer you commissions on any results we get online. We also will, once you hit 6 months, give you equity in any new website you build!<br /><br />So it's someone looking for the LONG BALL as well as a decent amount in the short term. We want a member of the TEAM<br /><br /><br />We will teach you all aspects of business. You are on the pulse with the CEO and the privilege to work with a a great team!<br /><br /><br />So it’s not just a job! It’s a JOURNEY!<br /><br /><br /><br />Have a think,.. We need the right person… the rest will fall into place.<br /><br />Team BoxSmart!"
