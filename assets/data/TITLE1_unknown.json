You will constantly be challenged to learn new technologies and extend your knowledge of Iridium’s products. &nbsp;We offer a very agile and empowered environment – if you have a great idea, speak up and present it to the team. If the team loves your idea, then we will look for you to implement it.&nbsp;</p><p>Iridium is an 8-year old company that thinks it is still a startup.&nbsp; What is nice is that we have the startup attitude, but also offer stable and long-term employment with a company that has positive cash flow and is not concerned about running out of money.&nbsp; We offer the start-up mindset, but without the fear that we will close our doors next month.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking for a relaxing job where you can work 8-5 Monday through Friday, then this is not the job for you. The Iridium work experience is fast-paced and high intensity. You will be a member of a team of extremely talented and highly skilled technical employees. We all bring our “whatever it takes attitude” to solving both technical and client issues. You will be empowered to showcase your technical skills and grit on a daily basis. You will be given massive responsibility and be expected to independently manage yourself. We can promise overtime, late nights, and even some weekend work. But we can also promise a great sense of achievement, and a supportive team environment that makes it all worthwhile. Are you a hard-charger?

Our product powers predictions for millions of users each month, and our customers range from e-commerce businesses to F250 companies.</p><p>We’re primarily based in Central London, but have a mixed remote and onsite team. We’re funded by top-tier infrastructure investors from the West Coast, and the founders are both technical and ex-YC / PhD. Salaries are competitive and include stock options.</p><p>We’re a tech heavy team with a flat structure and friendly atmosphere. We’re big believers in self-organising teams within an agile environment that put a heavy focus on creating user value first.</p><p>Our tech stack: Kotlin / Java 8, Python 3, numpy/scipy, Django, Typescript &amp; React, Apache Big Data projects, Linux &amp; Kubernetes</p><p>We’re hiring for the following roles:</p><p>- Frontend Developer (ONSITE) - We are looking for someone to lead the development of the front-end, developing on our existing workflow builder. We are open-minded in terms of technologies, but would be most comfortable architecting the product using React and TypeScript along with modern CSS UI libraries, so experience with these would be ideal. This will be a flexible role with a really unique scope for ownership and growth.</p><p>- Devops Engineer (ONSITE / REMOTE) - We’re developing the NStack PaaS to run on top of Kubernetes and many Google Cloud services, and are looking for a DevOps engineer with a focus on data engineering, CI/CD and deployment. The core NStack platform runs on the JVM using many tools from the Apache Big Data stack, along with large amounts of Python. We’re also heavy users of Linux containerisation, and NStack workflows are distributed on Kubernetes.</p><p>- Data Scientist (ONSITE) - We’re looking for an amazing Data Scientist to join our current data team to build reusable data-driven components and applications on the NStack platform. Ideally you’d have experience working as a data scientist in a team using Python (pandas, sklearn, numpy). Knowledge of the Big Data world (e.g. Hadoop, Spark, etc.), alongside an understanding of cloud and data infrastructure would be a bonus, as would experience with Bayesian statistical models and AutoML systems.</p><p>- Data Science Intern (ONSITE) - To join our growing Data Science team as described above</p><p>We’re looking at a range of positions and experience levels - whether you’ve just left uni or been hacking for 20 years, if you’re interested please get in touch. Any questions please comment, DM, reach out on email (jobs at nstack dot com) or at <a href='https://angel.co/nstack/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/nstack/jobs</a>.

If you’ve been on the pitch practicing your skills, you just might be the one we’re looking for.<br /><br />What you might do<br /><br />- Implement new features and enhance existing ones.<br />- Squash bugs that managed to slip past Saad’s keen eye while he was fixing observing his hair.<br />- Work with 1Password users to figure out why the app is crashing for them, but not for you.<br />- Refactor older code to follow more modern design patterns.<br />- Create unit tests for existing code to run faster and more reliably.<br />- Write documentation so that all of our platforms are consistent and the support team can learn about all of the awesome things you've built.<br />- Help new and existing 1Passworders via email or on our forum.<br /><br />What you have<br /><br />- Admiration for team effort. Solo blockers, Jedis, and Rockstars need not apply: We work together. Okay maybe Jedis, just for this one.<br />- A close bond and experience with Java and the Android SDK.<br />- A passion for using Android in your daily life. You're not just visiting, you live here. You also know your way around macOS and can appreciate Windows and iOS – from a distance  <br />- Excitement for the unknown and humility to learn – we're agile, so new things are always ready to be passed (and sometimes dodged).<br />- A penchant for clean code that's easy to read.<br /><br />What you might also have<br /><br />- Personal experience with 1Password.<br />- Familiarity with setting up and maintaining continuous integration.<br />- A friendship with Kotlin, and practice making it part of an Android app.<br />- Chrome OS running on one of your devices, and experience building apps for it.<br /><br />If you're a match<br /><br />Sounding like a jersey you’d rock? Tell us what color your jersey is."
