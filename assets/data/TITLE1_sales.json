We are a highly energetic, positive, resourceful team working virtually across the globe. We believe that executional excellence is key to success.</p><p>At Greenback, we provide you with the tools that you need to be successful and we bring our clients to you so that you can focus on preparing expat taxes and providing exceptional customer care!</p><p>This is not a traditional JOB- it’s more like a business partnership- and is ideally suited for those folks who love the idea of their earning potential being tied to their individual accomplishments, are obsessively organized and have a natural flair for customer care.</p><p><strong>What we’re looking for:</strong></p><ul><li>CPAs or EAs with 3-5 years of experience preparing US expat tax returns, including specific experience with the additional forms and schedules required for expats (1116, 2555, FinCen 114, 5471, 3520, etc.)</li><li>People who are comfortable managing their own schedule and workload. There are no set hours- you get paid for the work you do and your results. You take on as many customers as you choose (we pre-agree annual targets)</li><li>People who see technology as an enabler and embrace it fully. We use state of the art systems (Salesforce, Box, ProSeries, and Lacerte).</li><li>People who are extremely organized, especially in managing around deadlines. This is a deadline-driven business, so anyone who gets frazzled near a tax deadline or disorganized will struggle.</li><li>Strong attention to detail. Mistakes on tax returns are not cool. We need people who make sure there’s never an error or an oversight.</li></ul><p><strong>Why work with Greenback?</strong></p><ul><li>Again, this is not a traditional 9 to 5. No one has set hours- you have specific responsibilities and obligations related to timeliness of customer care, but it’s up to you to set a schedule that meets those timings.</li><li>No office/no commute. You have ultimate flexibility to decide where you work from and when you work. Want to spend tax season in your home office and the slower season working a lighter load from Mexico or Bali or the coast of Spain? Many on our team do just that.</li><li>You get paid directly in proportion to how many tax returns you complete. Your earning potential is unlimited and a good number of the accountants on our team earn six figures. However, this is also very personal and is directly in relation to your skillset. If you’re a hustler, have high expertise in US expat tax prep, work hard and stay organized, this is a great opportunity for you.</li><li>We have frequent bonus opportunities for excellence in staying organized, timeliness and attention to detail. We’ve heard our accountants described as “personal tax time hero’s”-we compensate accountants above the standard per return pay for above and beyond customer care</li><li>This opportunity is an ideal fit for people who are happy to work on their own, but don’t want to manage the business logistics like marketing, customer acquisition, billing, customer service, etc</li><li>We’re maniacal about customer care- we expect everyone to have an experience with us that makes them want to go straight out and tell their friends how wonderful Greenback is. Accountants who feel that’s important thrive with us and love how happy their customers are at the end of each tax season.</li><li>You will have access to a peer group of 30+ accountants that are the best in the industry in regards to not just US expat taxes, but also customer centricity.</li></ul><p>And the best news is- we’re hiring! The business is growing rapidly, and we’re looking to staff 5-10 more accountants this year alone.</p><p>Apply today!!!</p><p>To apply, please visit our website&nbsp;<strong>(we only accept applications via our website)</strong>: https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/jobs/expat-tax-accountant/.</p><p>We will follow up with all candidates within 5 working days with next steps.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/jobs/expat-tax-accountant/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>"

As a Business Sales Specialist, you’ll be the first point of contact for businesses that are considering 1Password. You’ll get the opportunity to help them learn more about the product, understand the best ways their team can use it, and get them started with a trial.<br /><br />What you’ll do<br /><br />- Help new business get started with 1Password, and keep the relationship with them strong.<br />- Proactively report on what potential clients need, and valuable feedback from existing ones, so the product team can improve the product and prioritize the right projects.<br />- Get to know potential customers over discovery calls and demos, and develop a relationship with them.<br />- Close several new deals per month, and generate new leads through outreach.<br />- Try new things: if something isn’t working, try a different tactic, reach out to the product team with questions, and help us reach different types of clients we haven’t encountered before.<br /><br />What you have<br /><br />- Passion for helping people succeed and feel more confident in their work.<br />- Experience with how businesses use software to be more productive and efficient.<br />- Adaptive explanatory skills that get people to understand, not just hear, what you're saying.<br />- A knack for learning things on your own and quickly adapting to new environments. Since 1Password is remote, it’s important to be independent in your research, but also have the humility to ask for help when you aren't sure about something.<br />- Excitement to speak with new people every day and do product demos and presentations with them.<br />- An understanding that conversation is about listening.<br /><br />What you also might have<br /><br />- Experience selling a product to someone – your siblings are lovely, but they don’t count.<br />- A track record with the acronyms SCIM, AD, CLI, SSO, and of course SAAS.<br />- Polyglottism! You could go to France or Germany for a week and jump right in to conversation, or do that from your computer, with a French riviera as your wallpaper.<br />- Personal experience with 1Password.<br /><br />Sounding like a hat you’d wear? Tell us what kind of hat that is."

Someone that can blatantly see how awesome BoxSmart is.<br /><br />someone that we can, literally, throw you leads (they come in daily) and service, nurture and grow a client.<br /><br />Commissions? Negotiatble. Not naff. A decent 20% chunk for the sales dept<br />Salaries? Probation we pay when you sell a fixed number of clients. We are true to our word. After that? we negotiate whatever you wish.<br /><br />BoxSmart is expanding too... To PouchSmart and also Meetup events!<br /><br />So if you want something that you feel part of. Something where we need your help on (Other than sales) and you want your BRAIN to be stimulated? Then drop us a line!<br /><br />We need a MINIMUM of three days a week from you.
