As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. Diversity drives our vibe. We unite employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.<p><strong><strong>Kibana</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>the</strong>&nbsp;W<strong>indow</strong> <strong>into</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Elastic</strong> <strong>Stack</strong></strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more.

Engineering challenges never discriminate between skills. What we offer our customers is that instead of one pair of eyes, they can have a whole team of people with different engineering and scientific backgrounds finding solutions for them. At Combine we strive to leverage the range and depth of our teams when offering solutions to our customers.</p><p>As a member of our team you will contribute with your skills, personality and experiences and further enrich our capacity for offering solutions.</p><p><strong>Will I always have the same role in the team?</strong></p><p>In Combine we do not believe in sticking people in boxes and leaving them there forever. We also don't believe in silos. We believe that you are a person with dreams, hopes and career ambitions. Cross collaboration is always encouraged. Exposure to new experiences brings change and growth to your profile. As you grow more, you are encouraged to take new roles or dip your toes into new techniques and step further away from your comfort zone.</p><p><strong>Do you work on projects, or is it consultancy only?</strong></p><p>Sometimes you will work with customers at their premises, sometimes in-house, sometimes a mix.</p><p><strong>How specialized is the work at your company?</strong></p><p>For some projects you will need to have a laser-focus on hitting a target, while on other projects and especially when doing on-site work you will need to use the full range of your peripherals in order to find what is holding a customer back.</p><p><strong>How does a typical work week progress for your Team?</strong></p><p>No two weeks are the same for our engineering Team! The common denominator is that there will always be a purpose and a real need behind the tasks you have been given, as well as a focus on providing meaningful and reasonable proposals back to the customers.</p><p><strong>I like science fiction / volunteering / beer brewing / computer games / climbing / board games / 3d printing / hobby electronics / running triathlons / MMA / knitting / mountain biking / e-sports&nbsp; <br></strong></p><p>Cool! So do we. These are some of the hobbies our engineers have.</p><p>Feel free to <a href='http://www.combine.se/contact/' rel='nofollow'>contact us</a> if you have any more specific questions!</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Sport activities</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Helth insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Wellness grant</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Phone allowance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Possibility to work from home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible pension system</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Gaming room at the office</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Conference and seminar activities</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Summer and Christmas parties</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

    "content": "<h3>Senior DevOps / Infrastructure Engineer</h3><div>Company: Logikcull<br><br></div><div>                                <div>Logikcull might be the most interesting company you haven’t heard of - yet. You probably use Dropbox or a similar service on a daily basis. Now imagine a service where customers upload entire email databases, nested zip files, images in every conceivable format (and some inconceivable), hard drive exports, and other content described as “anything and everything.” Logikcull customers need to understand this data quickly and thoroughly. Simple enough. Put it in S3, right? But here’s the catch, unlike Dropbox, Logikcull must rip the data apart, analyze metadata and text and then restructure it so that legal teams around the world can navigate complex discovery matters. Existing discovery solutions are tired and insufficient. Logikcull is truly something different.</div><div>This of course requires massive computing, storage, and supporting infrastructure that will surely feel small 6 months from now. Our technical challenges are both broad and deep. Emails have attachments and exist in threaded conversations. A Word document might be a simple letter or embed presentations or even entire email archives (yep, seen it) Almost anything can be printed to PDF.</div><div>Logikcull is a complex web application that sits on top of a distributed document processing pipeline that handles millions of documents and multiple terabytes of data each month. Current customer growth trends mean we have some serious infrastructure work ahead of us. You are important because we need help on multiple fronts. We must expand document processing capacity and performance, increase system reliability, and improve our security posture. Customers in 34 different countries (and counting) are depending on us.</div><div><span>It’s controlled chaos at scale and we love it. Here’s why:</span></div><div>The technical challenges are staggering, but the potential impact even small changes can have is incredibly motivating. Last month we shaved 8.5 seconds off of an important document processing step. Multiply that by 10’s of millions of documents and the impact is enormous. Engineers will find opportunities like this over and over.</div><div>The impact Logikcull is having on our society is likely even more rewarding. For example, our government customers are now responding to open records requests (i.e. FOIA), in days, not months or years (yep, not kidding) by using Logikcull. Citizens lawfully requesting and receiving government information in a timely fashion is crucial for our democracy. We’re committed to making this process better every day.</div><div>Similarly, we’re committed to changing the economics and logistics of discovery in litigation, which is often prohibitively expensive and complicated for those who need it the most. Logikcull makes it easy, fast, and affordable for anyone to participate in the discovery process. To us, litigation is sometimes required to affect positive change (<a href='http://logikcull.com/blog/into-the-wild-earthjustice-amanda-sharp/' rel='nofollow'>see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves, not a joke</a>) Discovery should not be weaponized. Access to justice should not be means-tested.</div><div>These are some of the reasons we do it. Do any of them speak to you? Our engineering team would love to meet you.</div><div><h3>What you'll be doing:</h3></div><ul><li><span>Make sure our current and future customers can be successful with Logikcull</span></li><li>Research, develop and document change plans for new infrastructure initiatives</li><li>Implement architectural change plans, guiding other engineers as needed</li><li>Perform capacity planning and technical risk assessments related to scaling</li><li>Study and understand our current usage patterns and system behaviors</li><li>Develop internal heuristics for expansion. “If ____, then we’ll add another node.”</li><li><span>Support backend document processing engineers</span></li><li>Work with team members to capture and analyze performance metrics</li><li>Build instances, provision, spec and size underlying resources as needed using modern, cloud-ready infrastructure-as-code solutions.</li><li>Perform data storage analysis and design systems that will handle growth (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, RDS)</li><li><span>Support frontend application engineers</span></li><li>Provide support for centralized application logging</li><li>Develop CI/CD workflows</li><li>Build and maintain testing environments</li><li><span>Be a great Engineering team member</span></li><li>Debug production issues across services and levels of the stack</li><li>Participate in a 24x7 on-call rotation</li><li>Share your expertise with us!

intended to be challenging - but the developers you meet and the topics you’ll be asked to explain (and code!) should give you a clear sense of what it would be like to work at Selerity.

We&nbsp;work&nbsp;with customers across a number of sectors, including e-commerce, media, healthcare, and&nbsp;fintech. The infrastructures we manage support millions of pounds of transactions every month.</p><p>Working with other Scale Factory colleagues, you'll help to build and support customers' platforms, working with their engineers to put together a foundation of good DevOps practise, helping them move faster, maintain uptime, and keep their secrets safe and secure.</p><p>Most of our work centres around ReadyScale, our platform design for scalable cloud infrastructure. This is currently built mainly from Terraform, Puppet, AWS and Ruby.</p><p><strong>Teams</strong></p><p>Our <em>Platform Engineering</em> team works on ReadyScale, adding features, fixing bugs, and deploying it to our customers.</p><p>Our <em>Customer Engineering</em> team supports and maintains deployed ReadyScale platforms for our customers, rolling out security patches and deploying platform improvements as well as keeping on top of support queries.</p><p>We're hiring for both teams right now, and if you're not sure where you'd fit best, that's fine -&nbsp;we rotate people through the teams from time to time. Everyone takes part in the out-of-hours on call rota, even the directors!</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Attitude, flexibility, and the ability to learn new technologies quickly, are all more important than years of experience. However you'll need production experience with:</p><ul><li>AWS</li><li>Linux (either CentOS or Ubuntu)</li><li>Configuration management (preferably Puppet, but a CM mindset is more important than the specific tool)</li></ul><p>Experience with the following would also be beneficial, but not required: Jenkins, Terraform, Packer, ELK, Vagrant, Prometheus, Docker, Kubernetes. As dictated by client requirements, we work with a number of different language environments&nbsp;and application frameworks. We even have one customer still running COBOL.</p><p>Honestly, if you're not sure if you have the relevant experience for this job, get in touch anyway and we'll figure it out together.</p><p><strong>Other</strong></p><p>The salary range listed here is indicative - we'll make you an offer based on your location and experience.</p><p>We're not looking to work with&nbsp;recruiters&nbsp;to fill this role.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://the-scale-factory.workable.com/jobs/57204/candidates/new' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About The Scale Factory</h2>            <div><p>The Scale Factory is a growing London-based consultancy. We design, build, operate, support and scale Linux infrastructure for clients of various sizes, across a number of business sectors.</p><p>We have an office near London Bridge, but we support remote working as long as you're within the UK; we encourage our team to make their own schedule with the hours that work best for them. That said, client visits (mostly London, but sometimes further afield) will occasionally be necessary, and some client engagements will influence the hours you'll need to be available - but most are pretty flexible around this too.</p><p>As well as monthly co-working days (one in London, one in Manchester), we bring the whole team together every couple of months for planning sessions, hack days, and socialising. We try to ensure that our social time is balanced and inclusive: we'll sometimes play board games in the office instead of just defaulting to&nbsp;a visit to the pub (though we do that from time to time too!)</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>25 days holiday per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>High spec Macbook or Thinkpad</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Budget for conference attendance (incl. international travel)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Culture of inclusivity</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Group life protection &amp; critical illness cover scheme</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Mixture of on-site and remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Friendly colleagues, with a wealth of experience to share</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours to suit you</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Training and development opportunities</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

We want to get this down to the hundreds of milliseconds domain. Interested? There is more...</p><p>Our external API is pure Hypermedia REST + oAuth on top of Pyramid. It mechanizes the Git layer and needs more features.</p><p>We can consistently generate from the same manifest a Docker container, an LXC one, or VM disk images (AWS, Azure, OpenStack), we want more targets.</p><p>We probably have the highest industry container density. We need to get it higher.</p><p>We support any Python, Ruby, NodeJS or PHP application, it’s time to roll-out Java and .NET, and Elixir, of course Elixir.</p><p>We need to have more auto-healing on the high-availability clusters. We need more performance out of our multi-protocol ssh proxy. We need work on our Ceph Implementation; We need to get the Debian package generation streamlined and faster. We need… great ideas on how to make Platform.sh even better. Interested? Join us!</p><p>We are searching in North America.

Our mission is to use these solutions to power the emerging economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, security and infrastructure, and more. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us. </p><p>The role:</p><p>Are you looking for the next frontier and challenge where you can apply your expertise in penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, and threat modeling?  Smart contracts are programs on a blockchain: they never go down, cannot be changed, and run as programmed.  These smart contracts directly control money, so you can see that their security is critical.</p><p>ConsenSys is a development pioneer of the Ethereum ecosystem and many of our tools such as Truffle, INFURA, MetaMask, BlockApps, are among the most widely adopted globally.  With ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.</p><p>ConsenSys is expanding its efforts on smart contract security to meet the needs of enterprise clients as well as home-grown platforms ranging from prediction markets to decentralized crowdfunding, including uPort, Gnosis, Stabl, WeiFund, and Virtue Poker.  Our aim is to build the most technically-gifted and engineering-focused blockchain security team.</p><p>We are looking to hire someone with a passion for Solidity, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and security.  Candidates should relish in technical subtleties and minutiae, and have a passion for combining them with a flair for creativity and insight to hack smart contracts.</p><p>A significant part of the work can be done remotely wherever you are; little travel is anticipated (most of the technical team works remotely around the world). There's also opportunity to stay ahead of demand and lead and build out this team in case that's also of interest. This will be an engineering-first development organization, with the autonomy to manage itself in a manner conducive to software development excellence. It will be rigorous, demanding and not for everyone. We are looking for exceptionally intellectual, bright and technically driven individuals. We will be addressing challenges that have not been encountered before while borrowing from patterns in previous software architectures.</p><p>Qualifications</p><p>Minimum qualifications:</p><p>1 year demonstrated expertise with Solidity, the EVM, and blockchain</p><p>3 years of relevant work experience.</p><p>BS degree in a relevant field or equivalent practical experience.</p><p>Coding/scripting experience in one or more general purpose languages.</p><p>Preferred qualification:</p><p>Demonstrated expertise and contributions towards smart contract security, EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals), or research.</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience analyzing the security of systems (penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, etc.).</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience, including experience in responding to security problems in target-rich environments, looking at security alerts, front-line analysis and response.</p><p>Programming experience in Python, C/C++, Java, or Go.</p><p>Advanced degree (MS, PhD) in relevant field is a plus.</p><p>Who We are, some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:</p><p>The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.</p><p>A dynamic startup environment with runway. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization. At ConsenSys, the runway allows you to focus on what you do best without worrying about the runway.</p><p>Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new technologies, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</p><p>Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much work to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users. </p><p>ConsenSys was just named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators report.</p></div>"

Our users are real estate developers, homebuilders, and sales agencies that use Lasso to convert prospects to purchasers and sell their developments faster and easier.</p><p>We have experienced consistent growth during the last decade and our user base asks a lot of our system. Scale, reliability, and innovation keep us learning on daily basis. You will join our server-side team to enhance and maintain our server-side Java 8 and Kotlin applications.</p><p>We have distributed systems hosted in AWS, which are presented to our users through an AngularJS frontend.</p><p>Moving forward, the biggest challenge we face is scaling our systems to work with a large dataset and high system load. You’ll help us build systems that can easily scale up and down the number of processing nodes as needed and implement rate-limiting to ensure rogue systems don’t impact our SLAs for other applications.</p><p>Additionally, you’ll improve the performance of our main data store by adding or changing indexes as appropriate, add caching functionality where possible and set up monitoring to catch performance bottlenecks early on.</p><p><strong>Culture and Work Environment</strong></p><p>As a fully remote team, communication is extremely important - there is no chance to drop in on interesting discussions around the water cooler or to see if someone is busy just by glancing at their desk.</p><p>We have systems to signal busy-ness; regular meetings and stand-ups to disseminate information, frequent one-on-ones to ensure there are no frustrations building up, a code of conduct and a formal complaint process to resolve conflicts early-on.</p><p>You thrive in a self-directed and open work environment. There’s no boss breathing down your neck, no deadlines, no fixed work hours and no in-office requirements. It’s really important that you can manage your time well, and you know what you need in order to do your job well (e.g. what work hours to pick so you have enough time to communicate with team members effectively)</p><p><strong>As a key member of our server-side team, you’ll specifically be expected to:</strong></p><ul><li>Design and build API endpoints for our internal and public APIs</li><li>Architect efficient task scheduling and processing systems</li><li>Keep up-to-date on new AWS features and integrate them into our tech stack if appropriate</li><li>Work closely with the Director of Engineering to adapt and develop our architecture and systems</li><li>Implement monitoring systems for performance bottlenecks on our main data store</li><li>Determine through performance profiling where to add caching to our distributed systems and internal interfaces</li><li>Monitor the growth of our datasets and assist in creating strategies to address the systems where growth could become an issue</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>Deep knowledge of the OOP paradigm, experience with functional programming and other approaches is a plus</li><li>Experience building complex systems with many moving parts, such as different protocols, varying restrictions on latency or CAP parameters</li><li>Knowledge of common logging and CI tools, at least on an abstract level</li><li>Excellent knowledge of static type systems and compiled languages</li><li>Deep knowledge of various data stores such as SQL, document stores, key-value stores or queuing systems, as well as their performance characteristics and scalability issues</li><li>Good understanding of caching and cache invalidation strategies</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>Work where and how you are most productive</li><li>You are not required to be in the office. Start time and work times are flexible</li><li>We’ll provide a development setup of your choosing, whether it’s a MacBook Pro or the components for a nice PC tower, you can pick whatever works best for you</li><li>Pick your own tools. We use what we know best. Windows, Mac, Linux, whatever you like</li><li>We provide you with a tools budget that you can use to make yourself productive ($300 per purchase, no authorization needed)</li><li>We know learning is a must on and off the job. We provide formal education matching (up to $1500 yearly) and funding for other continued learning, conferences, and workshops</li><li>Medical and Dental benefits</li><li>Great Vancouver-market salary</li></ul><p><strong>Interested?</strong></p><p>Lasso’s vision is to be the technology hub for new home sales in North America by providing a unique combination of remarkable software and expert services.

The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>A passion for making developers’ lives easier and happier</li><li>Thorough knowledge of CI/CD Tooling</li><li>Programming experience in Node.js</li><li>Comfortable with infrastructure as code and deployment to public clouds</li><li>Extensive experience in designing Unix/Linux system architecture</li><li>Deep expertise in deploying cloud solutions (AWS etc)</li><li>Solid experience with containerisation technologies (Docker, Kubernetes)</li><li>Experience with Terraform and other Hashicorp products.</li><li>Experience with production databases management and deployments</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.</li></ul><p><strong>About us </strong></p><p>Aula is a communication platform for education. Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital learning infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.</p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and <a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement. We’ve recently raised a $4.2m seed round and some people think we’re <a href='https://www.techworld.com/picture-gallery/startups/edtech-startups-watch-3643555/' rel='nofollow'>worth watching out for</a>.</p><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, Philippines, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan, Sweden, India, UK and US) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a> with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d <a href='https://cl.ly/2i0V3z453H2K' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Project A, Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>this blog post</a>, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p>For DevOps in particular, you’ll be working with tools like</p><ul><li>Terraform (‘infrastructure as code’)</li><li>Multiple database types</li><li>General Javascript including Node.js</li><li>Docker</li><li>AWS</li><li>Our internal CLI</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to build a DevOps setup from the ground up</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a seasoned developer that can take the lead on creating a fully automated DevOps setup to make our developer team really happy. &nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Infrastructure deployment/management:</li><ul><li>Management of our current infrastructure.</li><li>Monitoring of our resources: dozens of network interfaces, hundreds of servers, dozens of databases, etc.</li><li>Deployment of new infrastructure resources (new institutional environments)</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Tooling</li><ul><li>Integrate all the automation around infrastructure/deployments into the Aula-CLI</li><li>Create new tools to ease other developers’ lives/deployments</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Deployment/test pipeline</li><ul><li>Create/maintain the right pipeline in order to ensure maximal automation around running our tests and deployments</li><li>Full CI/CD pipeline</li></ul></ul><p>We already use a number of solutions for automating repetitive and/or critical tasks. All our infrastructure is managed via Terraform, and we’ve built a custom CLI that automates deployments, automates parts of the development and allow for easy troubleshooting and local development.</p><p>A big part of the role is to continue building on top of those existing tools and to bring new ones that would fit our environment and needs.</p><p>2 main rules:</p><ul><li>Infrastructure as (reusable) code</li><li>Automate all the things!</li></ul><p><strong>Interview process </strong></p><p>Interview processes don’t need to be scary and stressful for us to be able to pick out those of you that would fit in the best at Aula. The first three stages all take place asynchronously in a dedicated Slack channel filled with other curious and smart candidates - it’s turned out to be <a href='https://cl.ly/1P1P2i0k1320' rel='nofollow'>quite a community</a>. You’ll chat with Oliver about your experience and your thoughts particular topics. You’ll then receive a (~5 hour) test to complete over the course of 48 hours - on the weekend if you’d like. Then you get to meet the team on video conference. If both parties feel comfortable, we’ll then give you an offer to join us. The whole process takes place over the course of around 10 days, in your own time.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role.

And, of course, you’ll be dealing with dummies who think toolkits are what Dad keeps in the garage, and who don’t know networks from nachos. That’s pretty much all you’ll do, day in, day out, so if you’d rather eat your own face than be polite to people every damn day, stop reading.<br /><br />*Still here? Cool.* We also need you to document every step. So explain stuff to clients, and write it down. Officially, this is “retaining system knowledge”. Really it’s so when someone deletes the wrong thing and plunges of Europe into darkness, you can prove you didn’t tell ’em to do it.<br /><br />*To sum up so far:* <br /><br />• Answer the damn phone or email, log the damn tickets and help the damn client.<br /><br />• Don’t swear or say stuff like “hybrid cloud” unless you want to freak them out.<br /><br />• Prioritise. If someone says, “I’ve deleted the wrong thing and plunged half of Europe into darkness,” put ’em ahead of someone whose Instagram is freezing.<br /><br />• Pass the buck. No, really. If you can’t resolve the issue, escalate it to Sales, Accounts, Management or upper line support. None of them will thank you for this, so buy them drinks when we go out, even though all of them will be paid more than you.<br /><br />• Maintain a knowledge base and suggest ideas for improvement. Keep these work-related for the probation period, then try asking for at-desk massages and in-house baristas. You won’t get them, but it’ll be slightly harder for us to fire you.<br /><br />*Don’t bother applying unless you have, or can convincingly lie about having:* <br /><br />• one year’s experience on a technical and client-focused support desk.<br /><br />• one year’s customer service experience in any sector.<br /><br />• a logical approach to resolving functional and technical issues.<br /><br />• the ability to assess and document client issues, user experiences and processes.<br /><br />• a professional phone and email manner.<br /><br />• the ability to talk to people at different levels, with diverse backgrounds, without sighing or asking if they were dropped on their head as a baby.<br /><br />• experience of being accountable in a small team and the ability to work independently.<br /><br />• understanding of data protection and compliance principles, namely GDPR.<br /><br />*We need you to be organized,* systematic, a good communicator, a problem-solver, proactive, reliable and able to prioritise. You need to know the Microsoft Office suite too – but, let’s face it, even your grandma can work Outlook, Word and Excel these days.<br /><br />If you can do all that, you’re halfway through the door. If you can do all that, and you have experience of MS SharePoint (2010 and 2013), Zendesk, Targetprocess, remote assistance software and support portals, and conceptualising system frameworks and impacts, maybe those massages and baristas will happen.*<br /><br />*They won’t.<br /><br />*Interested?* please send us a CV and be sure to include a covering letter. That's right you don't go fishing without a hook. We look forward to hearing from you."
