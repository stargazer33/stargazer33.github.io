You do need to be willing to step in and help out on the front end.</p><p><b>Excellent communication skills</b><br> Communication is the key to just about everything in life, and this job is no different. We value communication skills over intense experience building scalable applications.</p><p><b>Other qualifiers</b><br> If this sounds like you, then consider applying! You’d be a great fit if:</p><ul><li>You are comfortable working with an opinionated framework like Django, Rails or Phoenix.</li><li>You’re able to make smart architectural choices and balance the trade-offs that come with building a Minimum Viable Product.</li><li>You’re comfortable shipping updates almost every day and tweaking things as you go rather than polishing a feature until it’s perfect.</li><li>You can write well-tested and documented code.</li><li>You’re not afraid of JavaScript and front-end frameworks.</li></ul><p>We’re based in Charleston, SC and would prefer to find someone who is here or willing to relocate. But we are open to working remotely with the right candidate.</p><h2><strong>What it’s like to be a Kritter</strong></h2><p><b>You’ll be a human, not a number</b></p><p>While we’re not perfect, we are crazy-passionate about creating a great place to work. We’re striving to build a culture that’s respectful, kind, supportive, and challenging. You won’t just be a number here, you’ll have a measurable impact on the direction of the business.<br> <b>You’ll enjoy the perks of a startup AND a balanced life</b></p><p>Working here is like working at a startup without the roller coaster. Or at least a much smaller, more manageable rollercoaster. We have flexible hours, a dog-friendly office, and a mini-fridge full of LaCroix. But we don’t expect you to be here until 10:00 every night.&nbsp;After breaks, meetings and life, we expect everyone to get in about 6 billable hours in a day. We don’t have unlimited vacation, because we want to make sure you actually use your vacation days.</p><p><b>You’ll be a part of an inclusive, transparent company</b></p><p>One of our goals is to build a more diverse company. To us, this means diversity of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, and national origin. We strongly believe in building an inclusive workplace where everyone feels safe and invited. We are also a fully transparent company. We share our finances, salaries, pipeline and more.</p><p><b>As developers:&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li>We’re focused on hitting business goals for our clients. Not building for building’s sake.</li><li>Design is core to everything we do; development often yields to design.</li><li>We use opinionated frameworks, so we can spend less time building the same old crap and more time focusing on what matters.</li><li>We write our code as if we’ll need to hand it off at any moment. That means tests, documentation, and lots of comments.</li><li>We’re not perfect. We’re always learning and getting better.</li></ul><p><b>You’ll be part of an engaged team</b></p><p>Every day at 4:00 we have a standing meeting where we check in and make sure we’re staying on track. Each week we have a team meeting where we look at project management, our finances, and the pipeline. Once a month you’ll have a one-to-one meeting with Andrew (our CEO) where you’ll look at your goals, progress, and be encouraged to give us feedback.</p><h2><strong>All roles at Krit come with:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;<b>Competitive&nbsp;Salary:&nbsp;</b>This will be a salaried position paid $70,200 per year, with opportunity to move up in salary as the company grows and becomes more profitable.</p><p>⚕️&nbsp;<b>Health, dental and vision:</b>&nbsp;We offer access to health insurance, dental and vision plans for all employees.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Work from home optional:&nbsp;</b>While we like to have everyone in our office in Charleston when possible, we have experience working remotely. If you’re in Charleston but just need to work from home, that’s fine.</p><p>⏰&nbsp;<b>Flexible hours:&nbsp;</b>Everyone is different. As long as you can be available for team meetings and are able to communicate effectively with the team, work when you work best. We do expect you to average about 6 billable hours per day.</p><p><b>&nbsp;Equipment budget:&nbsp;</b>Every new employee gets $2,500 to spend on equipment, so you can pick whatever works best for you.</p><p><b>&nbsp;Free books (and/or Audible subscription):&nbsp;</b>Reading makes you smarter, and smarter people do better work. We’ll pay for an audible subscription or buy you any new books, related to your work, that you’re craving to read.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Fitbit:&nbsp;</b>We value living a healthy lifestyle and weren’t sure how to manage gym memberships. So we’ll buy you a fitbit when you join the team.</p><p><b>&nbsp;Dog-friendly office:&nbsp;</b>Bring your pups to work! Duck (Andrew’s dog) is currently our office mascot, and he’s always looking for new furry friends.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Krit Day:&nbsp;</b>On April 10, we take the day off and do something fun that doesn’t involve work in the slightest. Last year we devoured pounds of barbecue, went bowling, and played Clue. Yes, that Clue.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Team lunches:&nbsp;</b>At least once a month we get out of the office and eat food together. It’s a chance to spend some quality time as a team and try a tasty place in Charleston!</p><h2><strong>How to apply</strong></h2><p>First, submit an application. If we think you might be a good fit, we’ll schedule a short, 30-minute phone interview with Andrew. During this time, you’ll get to know each other and dive into your background., If the phone interview indicates you’re a good fit, we’ll schedule a more in-depth 1-2 hour technical interview with our team.</p><p><b>The technical interview will consist of 3 parts:<br> </b></p><ul><li>Get to know the other Kritters and talk about your past projects.</li><li>Code review – you’ll review code that we’ve written and talk through how you would improve it.</li><li>System design – we’ll present a project and talk through the design and architecture of the system with you.</li></ul><p>There isn’t a coding portion of the interview, but you will be expected to communicate effectively, interpret code, and discuss architecture trade-offs.</p><p>We’re looking to fill this position by August 1st. During the process we’ll do our best to let you know if it’s not going to be a good fit. Thank you for taking the time to read this far, we can’t wait to meet you!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div> <a href='https://krit.homerun.co/back-end-developer/en/apply' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div></div>"

Our most immediate need is for an internationalization project on a mission-critical Python/Django application for a Fortune 100 client.<br /><br />The Company<br /><br />Incyte Studios was founded by a software developer, which means leadership focuses on generating new business instead of micromanaging developers. We'll keep you loaded to the brim with interesting work, give you the freedom and room to excel how you see fit, and offer mentorship to those seeking to learn from a team of veterans.<br /><br />The Soft Skills<br /><br />Remote work is tricky business. It takes a master of communication to succeed. The right candidates for this job are more interested in shipping good product than debating dogma about languages. If you're more into talking about the right amount of test coverage than shipping something, this probably isn't the right fit."

Our stack: React, Python/Django, Postgres on AWS. We are looking for&nbsp;<strong><u>very strong app dev backend Python skills</u></strong>. Lots of ORM work. Lots of complex business logic. When we say &quot;app dev backend Python skills&quot; we mean you've written hundreds of thousands of lines of complex python code over years in a deployed application used by thousands of end users, not a few a dozen deployment scripts used by other engineers on your team. That said, your front end skills can suck. :)</p><p>We are based in Durango, CO, but you can work anywhere in the U.S. You can work from home, or we will set you up in a co-working space with your own office wherever you want. There's minor travel a couple of times a year here to Durango which is a pretty fun place to&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to go to for work. We are perfectly set up for remote developers and most of our communication is via slack, email, and jira.</p><p>This is a standard software development job, so all the usual duties apply: write code, test code, review code, do tickets, occasional meetings for requirements (we keep it really light). The basic job is: write good code, get it live, rinse and repeat.</p><p>GitPrime is an amazing company. We are doing fascinating work to help engineers all over the world reach their potential as professional coders. We pay really well, have great benefits, give stock options so we all share in the upside, and we let you work from wherever you want.</p><p>Job Type: Full-time</p><p>Salary: $90,000.00 to $140,000.00 /year</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://gitprime.breezy.hr/p/b1978aecc4f0-back-end-python-developer?source=stackoverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>"

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$100K (mid-level), $100K-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We contribute to an HRA to offset the cost of health insurance or healthcare expenses.</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

The bulk of work is Python but we work with other \nlanguages quite frequently (C/C++, Java, and others) so we need diverse talent. \nMost, but not all of our jobs entail the application of ML or NLP. So \nexperience with that is a HUGE plus.\n\n You'll also be working with many different technologies, likely across all \nmajor platforms. And because you're considered an expert craftsman you'll often \nbe free to assess a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and storage, \nvirtualization, and automated configuration technologies on a per-engagement \nbasis choosing the ones that you feel best fit the requirements at hand. \nClearly stated, you're given considerable freedom, so being self-sufficient, \nconfident, and capable of navigating towards a positive outcome is just as \nnecessary as showing up.\n\n The majority of these positions are remote and the hours are flexible. If you \nare in the Boston area some clients may be on-site (we will compensate you \nwell).\n\n We will start you on a contract basis. If you do a good job, we will hire you \nwith full benefits after you have proven yourself (If that is what you want).\n\n NO RECRUITERS. \n * Principals only.

People you know will be using our product and we take pride in offering them a good service. <br /><br />About the role:<br /><br />As a lead developer at Stasher you'll be involved in building systems that support new client-facing features as well as working to improve our internal tools and systems. Your day might range from working on our core API, to planning a new host dashboard and managing junior engineers based remotely.<br /><br />We're looking for someone with a strong overall development background to help act as the bridge between business and tech and to make architectural decisions. This means you'll have a lot of responsibility and autonomy. You should have experience with, and a love for, building scalable back end systems and beautiful front end ones. Ideally you'll have actually built a few in your time. A solid understanding of React or other MVC style frameworks and Python<br /><br />We're building part of our development team in Athens so we're open to London candidates who are happy to manage remote devs and occasionally visit, or to Athens based candidates who are happy to visit London regularly.<br /><br />Essential: <br />- Love for crafting beautiful, well-tested code. Our backend is primarily in Python (flask) and frontend is in React.<br />- Happy to work fast and can strike a good balance between quality and quantity of work <br />- 4+ years experience working within a wider team<br />- Have an opinion on development processes and infrastructure that's appropriate for a budding scale up. This is really your chance to take the helm at a fast growing and funded startup; we don't just want you to 'use the technologies you want' but to have an informed opinion on what prepares us for scale!<br /><br />Desirable: <br />- Experience with Django or Flask. <br />- Experience with Heroku<br />- Experience with React<br />- Experience at a scale-up<br />- Open-source contributions. <br />- Strong sense of good engineering and architecture. <br />- Good understanding of security."
