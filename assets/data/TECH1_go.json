    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Boston, MA - USA Only)</strong> </p><p>Openly is building a next-generation insurance company from the ground up. We’re questioning the way things have been done in this industry for over a hundred years with an open mind to how customers want insurance to work—everything from how insurance is quoted &amp; sold, to the back-end operations that frustrate everyone and waste money. Insurance is one of a few remaining greenfield industries, with many interesting engineering problems that need a fresh perspective.</p><p>This isn’t something we’ve undertaken on a whim—we’ve been at this for a year, and planning for several years. We know we can do this because we’re the right mix of contrarian ideas backed by subject-matter expertise. The founding team brings executive-level experience from Liberty Mutual Insurance and Goldman Sachs, with mastery in actuarial science, computer engineering, math, and finance (MIT, Duke, and the University of Michigan). You can read more about the founders <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/ty-harris-73a40816/' rel='nofollow'>here</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-wielbut/' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. &nbsp;The rest of the team--the real strength of the company--are key early hires who are experts in their respective fields of statistics, actuarial science, and engineering. In aggregate, across the company, we’ve essentially built all of this before.&nbsp;</p><p>We were one of the 10 companies selected to Boston Techstars 2018 class. You can watch our <a href='https://vimeo.com/267654520' rel='nofollow'>Demo Day video here</a> to learn more about what we’re building.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a long runway and path to additional funding; we recently closed an oversubscribed round with a mix of amazing VCs and an exclusive group of angels made up of industry experts and executives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What kind of people do we gravitate to?</em></p><p>As a company, we place great value on curiosity, integrity, and ownership, both as character traits in members of the team, but also in the way we approach business and technical challenges. We want people who thrive in environments where they get to wear multiple hats. We’re looking for someone who wants to spend most of their time coding—a polyglot that is comfortable using multiple languages depending on the task at hand (but need not be a wizard/expert in any one language), and an autodidact who is excited to dive into a deep and quantitative subject matter. Insurance or finance knowledge is not required.</p><p><strong>We’re at a critical point in our company.</strong> Following a successful prototype, we’re now building the first production-version of everything. You will play a pivotal role in helping define everything from our engineering culture to the insurance product upon which customers will rely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What are the responsibilities?</em></p><p>We’re hiring for a senior engineer role. Your primary responsibility will be to develop the backend systems that power the pricing and sale of our insurance products. This includes but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>Integrating with a dozen data vendors to provide real-time information on hundreds of data points; everything from property characteristics, such as roof construction material, to weather-related data that help us predict flood risk or potential hailstorm damage.</li><li>Turning statistical models into production-quality code that can make pricing decisions, assessing a customer’s risk.&nbsp;</li><li>Build a smart qualifier that decides if an applicant is eligible to be insured, while also making sure to avoid purchasing expensive data for a lost cause.</li><li>Make important architectural and operational decisions like microservices vs. monoliths, deployment techniques, technologies, policies, etc.</li><li>Build an API to allow third-party resellers to purchase insurance from us programmatically.&nbsp;</li><li>And tons of future projects: machine learning for fraud detection, satellite/aerial imagery processing, IOT integration, etc.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What skills or qualifications would help you stand out?</em></p><ul><li>Computer science, engineering, or math-focused, college degree or equivalent experience</li><li>You’re proficient in Go/Golang, or some other compiled programming language such as Java or C/C++</li><li>You’ve written code that’s been deployed to production and used by 1,000+ strangers&nbsp;</li><li>You are a problem-solver who can balance between short-term and long-term solutions&nbsp;</li><li>You need to have excellent communication skills</li><li>You are technically proficient enough to solve hard problems independently, but you understand that collaborative solutions are usually better. &nbsp;You’re willing to ask for and offer help to your teammates to achieve the best solution</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What’s in our stack?</em></p><p>We’re careful to select technologies that are the right fit for solving the specific problem, not just the new hotness. We also place great importance in things we know really well. It’s often the nuances in a language or technology the make or break you in the long run.</p><p>Backend/Core</p><ul><li>Go</li><li>Postgresql</li></ul><p>Frontend:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>VueJS</li><li>Webpack</li><li>NodeJs/Express</li></ul><p>Research/Data Science</p><ul><li>R</li><li>ArcGIS</li><li>Python</li></ul><p>Infrastructure</p><ul><li>Google Cloud</li><li>Kubernetes</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Everything else:</em></p><p>This is full-time position.</p><p>Compensation is a mix of competitive salary and equity. We offer full benefits (medical, dental, vision) and contribute to your 401K.</p><p>We’re Boston-based, but we have some remote employees i.e. we’re open to any US-based applicants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> Equity + full medical benefits + 401K contribution</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> Send us your resume, GitHub link, or a description of recent projects, and why you'd be a good fit.</p>"

We believe we should treat our mental health like our physical health.<br /><br />Right now we operate in the workplace, where we place Sanctus Coaches into Businesses to create a 1:1 safe space where individuals can book a session to talk to someone impartial and confidential about their mental health.<br /><br />Our operation is fairly well established with 13 Sanctus Coaches working across 30 different businesses. We work with a diverse range of businesses like; Transferwise, Onfido, carwow, Secret Escapes, Red Bull, Boston Consulting Group, Aviva and loads more.<br /><br />*Your mission*<br />As our first engineering hire you’ll lay the foundation for the Sanctus platform. We’ve grown a broad range of passionate customers, who rely on us to create a space in their workplace for people to talk about their mental health.<br /><br />Our current product is a mixture of manual calendar scheduling between, Sanctus, the Coach and the Business, then a hosted booking system powered by an external provider with all of our online resources hosted on Medium.<br /><br />You’ll drive the product roadmap and engineering decisions to help develop a key part of our business. Phase 1 of this will be partner dashboard and customer facing profile/booking engine for coaches and businesses to schedule coaching days, and individuals to book individual sessions on site.<br /><br />You’ll plan and produce a platform that is built to scale with your choice of tech stack, we’re open to any modern open-source tech stack and hosting strategy, we only expect for you to be mindful of how the engineering team will grow and benefit from the technology decisions made at this stage. You’ll work alongside James, who’s our product focused founder, and you two will be the product team building the product that helps us achieve our mission.<br /><br />Given the scope and responsibility of this role we’re looking for someone with a minimum of 1–2 years experience coding and building product. A startup background isn’t critical but we’d like you to have experience of working in a fast-paced, lean and agile environment where you are experienced in delivering product quickly and at speed. We also hope that you’d have the ambition to move into a leadership role over time and that you are craving ownership of a product you believe really matters.<br /><br />*Your strengths*<br />* Passionate and experienced in full-stack web development.<br />* Ability to understand the needs of our customers, coaches and users.<br />* Ability to solve problems with incremental technical improvements<br />* Ability to quickly build and release product<br /><br />*Life at Sanctus*<br />* Currently we’re a full time team of 6, including the 2 founders and you would be employee no. 5.<br />* We have 13 coaches who are self-employed but feel very much a part of our team, so in total we’re 19 strong.<br />* Our home is in the Tea Building, Shoreditch and we work out of the ustwo Adventure space alongside companies like tray.io, easle.co, Tribe and others.<br />* We have a very open and receptive culture towards mental health and you might find us talking about the meaning of life or the use of psychedelics in therapy over lunch.<br />* We aren’t a fully remote organisation, but are willing to be flexible on remote working and keen to explore it further.<br />* We have our own Sanctus Coach that provides 1:1 coaching for our team, this is a space to talk about absolutely anything you want and it can be personal or professional, nothing is ever fed back to Sanctus.<br />* We also run monthly Sanctus Groups where we reflect on our own mental health as a team—this is for our coaches and our HQ team.<br />* We run monthly town halls, where we share our work-specific challenges with each other as a way to support one another.<br />* We have regular socials that don’t just mean drinking, but we do like to go to the pub too.<br />* Employees have 25 days holiday which they are encouraged to take and we talk about holidays in 1:1s<br />* We have a fairly relaxed approach to set working hours and appointments in the day etc.<br />* As a business we are profitable and growing sustainably with no investor pressures, we’ve raised no institutional money and are very much in control of our own destiny.<br /><br />*Disclaimer*<br />_We’re well aware that if you’re a techie living in London then you probably aren’t short of job offers with insane salaries and perks. We believe we offer competitive salaries and that we’re building a unique culture. What we do know is that what we can offer, better than most, is an abundance of purpose, mission and values._<br /><br />_This won’t be writing a load of code to help people get their food delivered faster, or so more people can see mobile ads—it’s so more people can talk to someone safely about their mental health._<br /><br />_If you put a lot of yourself into what you build, then we’d like to invite you to build something with us, because we believe that what we’re doing is making a real tangible positive impact on the world and we want you to help us do more of that._"

Our customers place a high level of trust in us, relying on our tools to operate their own infrastructure and software effectively, and so we care deeply about reliability and performance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This particular position is unique in that in addition to general Nomad backend engineering duties, this person will be the sole internal owner of the Nomad integration for Spark. &nbsp;We anticipate that work taking approximately 15-20% of this person’s time, and the rest of the time will be spent working on the overall Nomad roadmap along with the rest of the Nomad team. &nbsp;While we strive to hire at a variety of experience levels, this particular opening is not well-suited for recent graduates due to the level of independent ownership we expect for the integration for Spark. &nbsp;You will have the support of a Product and Engineering Manager in prioritizing and delivering work for the integration, but minimal fine-grained oversight from other Nomad Engineers. You will, however, benefit from direct interactions with users of the tool! &nbsp;This is an excellent technical leadership opportunity for someone with the capacity to operate well at this level of independence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At HashiCorp, we value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In your cover letter, please describe why you're interested in working at HashiCorp, and what draws you to this role in particular! &nbsp;Since this is a unique role on the team, we require a cover letter for your application to be considered complete.</p><p>In this role, you can expect to:Be the sole internal owner of the Nomad integration for SparkProgram in Golang for general Nomad work, learning from and contributing to a team committed to continually improving their skillsProgram in Scala for integration with Spark work, as an independent Scala expertWork on next-generation distributed systems for infrastructure managementDevelop novel algorithms within the context of our open source toolsBuild and architect systems for managing extremely large-scale global fleets of resourcesInterface directly with internal teams, users and HashiCorp customers, and represent HashiCorp well to the large Nomad communityOwn the full lifecycle of feature development from design through testing and releaseYou may be a good fit for our team if:You are fluent in Scala or a similar language (Java skills with an understanding of functional programming concepts is a workable substitute)You are interested in learning Golang if you aren’t already well-versedYou have past experience working with large batch data workloads, and can empathize with the problems that Spark solves for its usersYou’re familiar with systems engineering, with networking and operating systems, and are comfortable with low-level programmingYou have prior experience working in high performance or distributed systems; while we strive to hire at a variety of experience levels, this particular opening is not well-suited for recent graduatesYou can knowledgeably discuss tradeoffs in distributed systems, such as those made for debugging and performanceYou're familiar with the pieces of typical modern infrastructure: secret storage, service discovery, etcYou’re able to reason about performance, security, and user interactions in complex systems&nbsp;</p><p>At HashiCorp, we are committed to hiring and cultivating a diverse team.
