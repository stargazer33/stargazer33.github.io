To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><h2><span><br></span></h2></div><div><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong> 1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We don’t work like that.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><span></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span><span></span></div><div><h2><span><br></span></h2></div><div><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2></div><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

Your presence will have a very real impact on the company’s value.<br><br>We are looking for a **Backend Web Developer** to join our tech team’s efforts to **supercharge our PHP web application**. You will be working directly with Pierre-Camille, our founder, who developed the original product from scratch, as well as with all members of the tech, marketing, and success teams.<br><br>Our company is fully distributed and remote. We believe and fully embrace that your best environment is wherever you - personally - feel the most productive and comfortable for day-to-day work. Nevertheless, we organise frequent meetups and retreats for the team to physically meet throughout the year. The last two trips were to Lisbon/Cascais and Paris!<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>**⭐️ What you will do: ⭐️**<br><br>• You will be an **architect**: planning structural masterpieces, laying foundations, building pillars, and reinforcing walls.

You have written superbly abstracted code and accompanying unit tests from scratch. You have also refactored legacy, non-testable code into something less apocalyptic.<br><br>• **Caring Developer**: you recognise that your code and work impact not only the customers but also the rest of the team. You conduct yourself with professionalism and respect not only in meetings but also in how you structure your code and in the documentation that you write.<br><br>• **Superb English fluency**: we are an international team and clear communication is vital. It goes without saying (but we’ll say it anyway) that you absolutely must have the ability to participate in frequent video meetings.<br><br>• The product team is based in Europe, so at the moment we are looking for developers who are based within the same general time zones (UTC±3).<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>** Brownie points: **<br><br>• You have experience with Continuous Integration using Travis, Circle, Gitlab, or Bitbucket.<br><br>• Interactive Git rebasing doesn’t sound like voodoo to you.<br><br>• You’ve used in Git commit messages.<br><br>• You have experience with Machine Learning either with off-the-shelf tools like Dialog Flow or - better yet - more low level using tools and platforms like Theano, Torch, and Google/AWS/Microsoft/IBM ML stacks.<br><br>• You’ve built a Node.JS backend or API.<br><br>• You see past the glossy veneer of the ‘microservices’ buzzword and know when and how to build them.<br><br>**(Let us know how many  you deserve.)**<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>** What we offer: **<br><br>• Competitive salary, including the possibility of stock options.<br><br>• Ample paid leave, in addition to maternity and paternity leave.<br><br>• A great support structure: we are here for you.<br><br>• Flexible contract.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span></p><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>1. Solve Interesting Problems</span></p><p><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</span></p><p><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We don’t work like that.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</span></p><p><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>4. Get Expert Guidance</span></p><p><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</span></p><p><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</span></p><p><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>7. Stability You Can Count On</span></p><p><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</span></p><p><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span></p><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><p><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered. </span></p><h2><a href='https://iphonephotographyschool.com/developer/?utm_source=authenticjobs' rel='nofollow'><span>Click Here To Apply</span></a></h2><p><span>If you delay submitting your application, someone else will be hired before you.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</div><div><br></div><div>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</div><div><br></div><div>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</h2></div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</div><div><br></div><div>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</div><div><br></div><div>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</div><div><br></div><div>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</div><div><br></div><div>We don’t work like that.</div><div><br></div><div>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</div><div><br></div><div>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</div><div><br></div><div>We get how important growth is for developers.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</div><div><br></div><div>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</div><div><br></div><div>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</div><div><br></div><div>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</div><div><br></div><div>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</div><div><br></div><div>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</div><div><br></div><div>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</div><div><br></div><div>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</div><div><br></div><div>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</div><div><br></div><div>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Here’s What We Expect From You…</h2></div><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re excellent at PHP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have an excellent attention to detail</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered.&nbsp;<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Apply Here: https://iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer?utm_source=WhereverJobs</h2></div><div>If you delay submitting your application, someone else will be hired before you.</div>            </div><div>Apply here: <a href='https://iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer?utm_sourceWhereverJobs' rel='nofollow'>iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer</a></div>"

Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</div><div><br></div><div>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</div><div><br></div><div>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</div><div><br></div><div>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</div><div><br></div><div>We don’t work like that.</div><div><br></div><div>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</div><div><br></div><div>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</div><div><br></div><div>We get how important growth is for developers.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</div><div><br></div><div>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</div><div><br></div><div>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team.

Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</div><div><br></div><div>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</div><div><br></div><div>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</div><div><br></div><div>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6.

So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue.

Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</div><div><br></div><div>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</div><div><br></div><div>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Here’s What We Expect From You…</h2></div><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re excellent at PHP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have an excellent attention to detail</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong><br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

You'll write code that helps power mission-critical tools for millions of online stores.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Role</b></div><div><br></div><div>You’ll focus on building new features and maintaining existing code, while also helping with code reviews and customer support. With over 60 different plugins, there’s a wide variety of work. You might spend time on some complicated frontend interactions using JS, then switch focus to working with a tricky external REST API for a while, and later work on adding unit/acceptance tests to our framework code.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll have the opportunity to really dive into a problem and understand it before crafting a well-engineered, high quality solution. We believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time to think and code.</div><div><br></div><div>Our plugins are built on top of WordPress and designed to work with WooCommerce, so we use PHP 5.3+ (moving soon to PHP 5.6 minimum) and we write all new JS in CoffeeScript. We follow a superset of the WordPress coding standards and actively invest in tooling &amp; testing to improve both the quality of our products and the happiness of our team building them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We work primarily through GitHub and Slack, so you should be able clearly express your ideas via comments and messages.

<div><p><strong>The No-Bullshit-iest Way We Can Describe This Job In The Least Amount Of Words In A Run-On Sentence: </strong></p><p>We build a lot of different kinds of stuff for a lot of different kinds of folks (<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/work/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/work/</a>) at a shop that is big enough to bite off important, meaningful work and small enough to have fun doing it and we’re looking for an engineer who is equally at ease talking to clients, designers, producers, and developers about things like scope, resource allocation, solutions to engineering problems, creative ideas for how to build things, ways to articulate technical complexity to normal business humans...and occasionally...cut some code.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Think You Probably Need to Be Successful At This Job: </strong></p><ul><li>Have agency experience, leading a development team spread across multiple projects and clients.</li><li>Hands on developer and leader</li><li>Are comfortable reviewing project specifications, collaborating with company leadership to develop project estimates and technical specs</li><li>Experienced in code reviews to adhere to best practices and internal standards, providing feedback and following up on remediation</li><li>You have an ear to the ground for new tech, whether it comes from hacker news or a programming subreddit, and a desire to dive in and try it out.</li><li>Experience in architecting and building bespoke custom WordPress themes using Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast with custom integrations to third party systems.</li><li>Experience in client and server-side debugging, performance profiling and optimization techniques with an uncanny intuition for finding the cause and solution</li><li>Experience with integration of analytics, a/b testing, and advertising platforms using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Planning out projects in coordination with Project Manager/Producer and Developer team members, participating in project check-ins providing feedback to the team</li><li>Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals</li><li>Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA</li><li>Comfortable working with small projects (1 dev) and medium projects (2-3 devs)</li><li>Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation</li><li>Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI</li><li>Comfortable in architecting and implementation of APIs in PHP/Laravel, NodeJS/Express and other similar stacks.</li><li>Attention to detail and a seamless user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.</li></ul><p>To Apply:&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life. Just tell me.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/192578?reset=False&amp;ra=12AfxD422agE&amp;oqs=a%3D12AfxD422agE' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Sanborn</h2>            <div><p>We're a 25-person interactive shop working with all manner of organizations (sports teams, beauty brands, magazines, non-profits, pharmaceutical companies, startups) helping to create and manage the full battery of digital media goodness (web, mobile, content, video and experiential activations to be specific).</p><p>We believe passionate, talented people all working together smoothly yields awesome work that lets us come back and do it again tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Some more about where we stand as a company:&nbsp;<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/about</a></p><p><strong>About Our Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>The team is made of folks who seem to enjoy bouncing in and out of different projects of different sizes with varying engineering challenges associated with them.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Our designers are highly technical and our engineers are very invested in the visual fidelity of their work - so some of the lines that typically divide UI/UX and engineering cultures don't really exist here.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>At any one given time we'll have folks on longer term missions (ie - 6 to 8 month long-term projects where we're in more of a product development posture) and people on shorter term campaign-based work where we're trying to explode a firecracker in the sky, measure how far and bright it travels, and then move onto to the next one.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>We try to keep plates of work varied and diversified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Everyone is a grownup.&nbsp;</li></ul>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work friendly environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full health benefits package.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Los Angeles office locations.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shithead eco-flush system ensuring shitheadless working environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family owned and operated.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><h2><span><br></span></h2></div><div><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong> 1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We don’t work like that.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><span></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span><span></span></div><div><h2><span><br></span></h2></div><div><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2></div><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span></p><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>1. Solve Interesting Problems</span></p><p><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</span></p><p><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We don’t work like that.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</span></p><p><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>4. Get Expert Guidance</span></p><p><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</span></p><p><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</span></p><p><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>7. Stability You Can Count On</span></p><p><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</span></p><p><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span><strong></strong></p><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><p><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered. </span></p><h2><a href='https://iphonephotographyschool.com/developer/?utm_source=authenticjobs' rel='nofollow'><span>Click Here To Apply</span></a></h2><p><span>If you delay submitting your application, someone else will be hired before you.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"
