Our team works remotely from all over the world.</p><p>Our sole focus is building an application called&nbsp;<a href='http://www.cliniko.com/' rel='nofollow'>Cliniko</a>. Cliniko makes life easy for Allied Health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes and a bunch of other things. It's quite a neat system and is used globally by tens of thousands of people every day.</p><p>Things we love to do:</p><ul><li><p>Provide great software and service.</p></li><li><p>Work with talented people.</p></li><li><p>Delight our customers.</p></li><li><p>Make the world a little bit better.</p></li></ul><p><strong>HOW WE WORK</strong></p><p>We work smarter, not harder. We think work/life balance is important and we work a 30-hour week as standard (you still get a full-time pay; itâs a full-time position).</p><p>Even though we're based out of Melbourne, Australia, our team is spread around the world. We want to hire the best person available, not just the best person within a 10km radius. You can see our team's locations on the&nbsp;<a href='http://www.redguava.com.au/' rel='nofollow'>Red Guava</a>&nbsp;website.</p><p>If you want to know more about how we work (which really is quite different), our founder Joel gave a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_2jXqzxBNU' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about it.</p><p><strong>THE JOB</strong></p><p>We are looking for an amazing software developer to join our team. This doesnât mean you need to have 5+ years experience in the industry, we care about skill, passion and integrity much more than credentials.</p><p><strong>WHO YOU ARE</strong></p><p>You are a software developer presumably, otherwise your chance of success for this role is quite low.</p><p>You love to code and for your work to have a positive impact. You want to have fun and enjoy yourself. You want to constantly improve.</p><p>You're comfortable working in at least a few of these:</p><ul><li><p>CSS</p></li><li><p>DOM</p></li><li><p>Client side JS</p></li><li><p>JSON APIs</p></li><li><p>Web frameworks</p></li><li><p>Relational databases</p></li><li><p>Redis/Sidekiq</p></li></ul><p>Experience with Ruby on Rails, Angular JS and React are quite a bonus, but not required.</p><p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL WORK ON</strong></p><p>Youâll spend your time developing Cliniko. Things you might be doing include:</p><ul><li><p>Adding new features to Cliniko.</p></li><li><p>Improving existing features.</p></li><li><p>Fixing bugs.</p></li><li><p>Refactoring code.</p></li><li><p>Making Cliniko faster.</p></li><li><p>Anything else you think needs doing.</p></li></ul><p>Basically, you'll be making Cliniko better for our customers.</p><p><strong>GREAT WORK ENVIRONMENT</strong></p><p>We want people doing their best work with us. We know that needs a great work environment, and we don't just mean a flashy office. Some things we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:</p><ul><li><p>30-hour work week</p></li><li><p>Complete autonomy</p></li><li><p>Work whenever you want</p></li><li><p>Work from anywhere</p></li><li><p>Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year)</p></li><li><p>Supplied computer equipment</p></li><li><p>Ergonomic furniture</p></li><li><p>Fresh organic fruit weekly to your home</p></li><li><p>Overseas trips for full team meetups (family invited and paid for too)</p></li><li><p>No managers</p></li><li><p>No meetings</p></li></ul><p><strong>IN SUMMARY</strong></p><p>Letâs be clear, you do need to be seriously amazing. We are a small team and we want to keep it that way, we don't hire often. We will offer you the best job you have ever had with plenty of perks, but we expect you to be super-talented.</p><p>You should be absolutely passionate about building great software. You should take pride in your work and be excited to share it with our users.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Job applications close 18th July 2018.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> Read the how to apply section at https://jobs.lever.co/redguava/960bdf6d-0731-490e-981b-becf83492a17 and then click the apply button!</p>"

Our team works remotely from all over the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Our sole focus is building an application called <a href='http://www.cliniko.com' rel='nofollow'>Cliniko</a>. Cliniko makes life easy for Allied Health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes and a bunch of other things. It's quite a neat system and is used globally by tens of thousands of people every day.</div><div><br></div><div>Things we love to do:</div><ul><li>Provide great software and service.</li><li>Work with talented people.</li><li>Delight our customers.</li><li>Make the world a little bit better.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>HOW WE WORK<br></span></div><div>We work smarter, not harder. We think work/life balance is important and we work a 30-hour week as standard (you still get a full-time pay; itâs a full-time position).</div><div><br></div><div>Even though we're based out of Melbourne, Australia, our team is spread around the world. We want to hire the best person available, not just the best person within a 10km radius. You can see our team's locations on the <a href='http://www.redguava.com.au/' rel='nofollow'>Red Guava</a> website.</div><div><br></div><div>If you want to know more about how we work (which really is quite different), our founder Joel gave a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_2jXqzxBNU' rel='nofollow'>talk</a> about it.</div><div><br></div><div><span>THE JOB<br></span></div><div>We are looking for an amazing software developer to join our team. This  doesnât mean  you need to have 5+ years experience in the industry, we care about skill, passion and integrity much more than credentials.</div><div><br></div><div><span>WHO YOU ARE<br></span></div><div>You are a software developer presumably, otherwise your chance of success for this role is quite low.</div><div><br></div><div>You love to code and for your work to have a positive impact. You want to have fun and  enjoy yourself. You want to constantly improve.</div><div><br></div><div>You're comfortable working in at least a few of these:</div><ul><li>CSS</li><li>DOM</li><li>Client side JS</li><li>JSON APIs</li><li>Web frameworks</li><li>Relational databases</li><li>Redis/Sidekiq</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Experience with Ruby on Rails, Angular JS and React are quite a bonus, but not required.</div><div><br></div><div><span>WHAT YOU'LL WORK ON<br></span></div><div>Youâll spend your time developing Cliniko. Things you might be doing include:</div><ul><li>Adding new features to Cliniko.</li><li>Improving existing features.</li><li>Fixing bugs.</li><li>Refactoring code.</li><li>Making Cliniko faster.</li><li>Anything else you think needs doing.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Basically, you'll be making Cliniko better for our customers.</div><div><br></div><div><span>GREAT WORK ENVIRONMENT<br></span></div><div>We want people doing their best work with us. We know that needs a great work environment, and we don't just mean a flashy office. Some things we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:</div><ul><li>30-hour work week</li><li>Complete autonomy</li><li>Work whenever you want</li><li>Work from anywhere</li><li>Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year)</li><li>Supplied computer equipment</li><li>Ergonomic furniture</li><li>Fresh organic fruit weekly to your home</li><li>Overseas trips for full team meetups (family invited and paid for too)</li><li>No managers</li><li>No meetings</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>IN SUMMARY<br></span></div><div>Letâs be clear, you do need to be seriously amazing. We are a small team and we want to keep it that way, we don't hire often. We will offer you the best job you have ever had with plenty of perks, but we expect you to be  super-talented.</div><div><br></div><div>You should be absolutely passionate about building great software.  You should take pride in your work and be excited to share it with our  users.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Job applications close 18th July 2018.</b></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Read the how to apply section at <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/redguava/960bdf6d-0731-490e-981b-becf83492a17' rel='nofollow'>https://jobs.lever.co/redguava/960bdf6d-0731-490e-981b-becf83492a17</a> and then click the apply button!</p>  </div>"

Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization.

At Pyrofex, we do things differently: we hire great engineers, give them the tools to do great things, and expect them to do so. We are invested in each team members growth and foster a workplace that celebrates accomplishments and hard work.</p><p>Pyrofex is hiring. Show us your best work.</p><p>About Us</p><p>Pyrofex Corporation is changing the blockchain game and quickly growing a world-class team to do it. As Utah Valleyâs first cryptocurrency startup, founded in 2016 by ex-Googlers Mike Stay and Nash Foster, Pyrofex is busy creating next-generation blockchain platforms that are simple, secure, and always reliable. We take pride in our work. We set high expectations for everyone, from our founders to each team member, and as a result we deliver extraordinary products and services.</p><p>At Pyrofex, we hire for strength, not for lack of weakness. We hire for capability and talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hire people who have a passion for quality and innovation. Each team member achieves great things in an environment supporting both independence and collaboration.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>You collaborate well with others to design and architect our complex systems. You take the amorphous sets of needs and use cases and distill these into written designs and specifications. You demonstrate a fastidious attention to detail, knowledge of your programming tools, and the ability to regularly produce working, correct code.</p><p>Pyrofex hires engineers at all levels of experienceâfrom current students to engineers with decades of experience. After all, one of our founders has a Ph.D., and the other dropped out of college, twice! The path we've taken to get this far is unique and we suspect the same will be true of our best employees.</p><p>We are most interested in hiring programmers with knowledge of functional programming, a background in computer science, and can program in Scala. However, if you think this job is for you, we'll take a look.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Our Software Engineers will help us deliver various products and platforms, which are written in Scala, C/C++, Python, and JavaScript. The engineers on this team will design, implement, test, deploy, and manage a large-scale global software system using Linux and the JVM. Pyrofex builds cryptocurrency systems and large-scale distributed and decentralized applications.</p><p>Five years ago, we thought things like SRE and DevOps would make it clear what &quot;deploy and manage&quot; meant for the future, but now we know we were wrong. The future is changing too fast and our job is to keep up. That said, from time to time, we all have to get out of bed at 2AM to deal with something broken.</p><p>If this sounds good to you, then e-mail us at <strong><a href='mailto:jobs@pyrofex.net' rel='nofollow'>jobs@pyrofex.net</a></strong> with the subject line, âSIGN ME UP!â and your resume or linkedin profile. We would also enjoy a cover letter telling us about your work ethic and your favorite project. If you can send us examples of your code, that would be most excellent.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/173627?reset=False&amp;ra=WecHwmYEr1m&amp;oqs=a%3DWecHwmYEr1m' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>                    <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>New Technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with a highly intelligent and productive team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full Health benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great communication amongst the team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Build from the ground up and make progress!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Work Available</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

    "content": "h1. For developers, insurtech is the playground you never knew you wanted. <br /><br />Weâre taking on big, never-before-solved problems with new technologies - all while fully funded and facing massive growth in a stable, wealthy industry.<br /><br />When you join us, weâll kit you out with a full spec Macbook Pro, likely set you up to pair with another developer and get you into the codebase as quickly as possible. As a startup, we need you to be curious, tenacious and driven, constantly looking for new and better ways to build our complex product using new and better processes, tools, frameworks, whatever it takes.<br /><br />In our small team there is enormous scope to have your say, to influence how we work, what we work on and, ultimately, what Wrisk will become for our future millions of international users. And we'll offer you some ownership in the business, so you'll share in every success ahead of us.<br /><br />h2. What youâll do<br /><br />As a full stack developer you will take features from start to finish, collaborating with others as you go. You will be often required to turn your hand to something new, possibly something you have not done before; you might pair with a specialist in areas where we have in-house expertise or following industry best practices from your own research. <br /><br />You'll be working very closely with CTO Alex to build out a micro-services architected platform - the engine that powers the Wrisk app. This platform integrates with many clients from our own app to external data sources and third party solution providers, so there's a lot to do. <br /><br />Applications are written Kotlin, so demonstrable experience creating production quality JVM based applications is pretty much essential. If you've worked on delivering a mobile friendly RESTful API that would be a bonus, and if that has led you to thinking of tools like Dropwizard and Swagger, all the better. <br /><br />You should have some demonstrable experience using a modern JavaScript technology to build user facing applications. We currently use React/Redux for some of our internal web applications and are migrating our Swift mobile application to React Native so any experience with RN is a huge plus.<br /><br />Finally, youâll be deploying the apps youâve written to our environment in AWS. You should be familiar with Infrastructure As Code and containerisation using technologies such as Terraform and Docker.<br /><br />h2. How youâll work<br /><br />While what you work on is well-structured and organised, how you work is up to you. The office is relaxed, with flexible working available to everyone. Youâll meet with your whole team every morning (remotely by video if youâre away from the office) followed by a quick tech huddle, but other than that your time is your own. If you want to take 10 minutes to clear your head with meditation, a trip to a local hipster coffee shop or a game of table tennis - go for it. Nobodyâs clock-watching. We just care that the work gets done, to a high standard, on time.<br /><br />We believe in, and practice, the Lean ideas of build/measure/learn, and will be very happy to show you the kanban storyboard you will be building from. You will participate in, and often lead, our retrospectives, as well as presenting at the bi-weekly showcases, to the wider team, which are essential for ensuring we are all on the same page.<br /><br />We typically start with a workshop to define what we need to achieve, leading to wireframes and perhaps some high level tasks. We refine and test until we believe we have the core of what we want and then we build the smallest amount we can to validate this - sometimes in code, sometimes in prototype. We do regular user testing, rapid prototyping and code spikes to ensure we only build the most-right thing we can right now.<br /><br />h2. What youâll get<br /><br />Our future actually looks even rosier from inside the company, where we can see whatâs on the roadmap and whoâs expressed an interest in us. We already have investment and support from some major partners. Weâre going places - and we want you with us. You'll help build the path that gets us there, with some equity of your own so youâre properly rewarded when we arrive.<br /><br />We also offer a competitive salary, 30 days holiday allowance (with public holidays on top) and flexible working conditions. We're currently based in Techspace Shoreditch, a short walk from Old Street. Our offices are modern and bright, with the startup-essential posh coffee and ping pong table, as well as indoor bicycle parking and shower."

Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet theyâre still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Designs and develops web applications using Java, PHP, Spring Framework, MySQL</p></li><li><p>Designs and develops unit test cases to make the code more robust</p></li><li><p>Participates in pairing and code reviews.</p></li><li><p>Support and troubleshoot problems with existing applications</p></li><li><p>Participates in the areas of architecture, design, implementation, and testing</p></li></ul><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Over 3 years experience in Java, Spring and MySQL (or any relation database)</p></li><li><p>Experience developing web and stand-alone applications in Spring technologies such as: Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Batch</p></li><li><p>Excellent communication and analytical skills</p></li><li><p>Proficient with spoken/written English</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nice to have but not required:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Experience in PHP</p></li><li><p>Familiarity with front-end technologies â Object-Oriented Javascript, AJAX, XHTML, HTML, XML/DOM</p></li><li><p>Experience with unit testing framework, test driven development</p></li></ul><p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Very competitive salary based on prior experience and qualifications</p></li><li><p>Potential for stock options after the first year</p></li><li><p>Visa sponsorship (if outside the US sponsorship is granted after 18 months with the company, based on performance)</p></li></ul><p><strong>How to Apply</strong><br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do ask what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers.</p></div>"

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique âkernelâ of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;âsource codeâ for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

It is about a sophisticated hybrid app which merges video, audio, images and social media into one single place for the consumer. Part of the app are customized players, intelligent caching and offline availability of media data, social media features and a super modern UI with a great UX design.<br /><br />We are currently looking for talented developers on the global market to be a part of our team of developers, currently located in offices in Hamburg, Berlin, San Francisco and Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we are also open to opportunities for hiring developers from other cities around the globe to work remote on our devices.<br /><br />The project offers a series of challenges for being an iterative process, where we are always implementing and experimenting with features in a fast-paced environment. That promotes growth by giving you the responsibility to be always contributing with code that impacts directly the user experience.<br /><br />Technically, some of the main challenges involve dealing with multiple sources of media playback, managing and improving the many ways users can interact with these media (which are also conditioned by media types and app context, and maintaining and evolving the architecture, aiming to guarantee code that is well structured, solid and as accessible as possible for new developers, despite continually being changed by our iterative process."

And for retailers, an actual understanding of the customers who came to their store and re-engagement with them (with their consent of course!).<br /><br />Flux is regulated and authorised by the FCA as the first regulated Account Information Service Provider under new Open Banking regulations.
