    "content": "*SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE*<br /><br />OLIO is the world’s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home & local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food – which can be households or local businesses – with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away £800 of food each year - collectively adding up to £15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile & web apps. Over the past 2 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. <br /><br />We now have over 465,000 users who have together shared well over half a million portions of food – with food being successfully shared in 32 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our volunteer programme, with over 19,000 people reaching out to spread the word about OLIO in their local community and rescue unsold food.<br /><br />OLIO is now looking to grow our core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.<br /><br />*JOIN OUR TEAM!*<br /><br />In order to accelerate OLIO to its next level in growth and impact, we are recruiting for a Data Analyst & Dashboard Developer, who will report into Viv Taylor, Product Manager.<br /><br />In this role you will be responsible for:<br /><br />* Data Analysis: Analysing key business questions in our burgeoning data via an SQL interface (both through<br />GUI and command line tools)<br />* Data Visualization: Development of a “data dashboard” for the company to help us interrogate our data<br />visually and in a user friendly manner<br />* Data Innovation: Liaison with our broader OLIO team to ensure that the right questions are being asked of<br />our growing datasets, in the right order.<br />* Data Exploration: Evaluation of the effects of specific initiatives/experiments at OLIO, generating and<br />presenting reports of their efficacy<br />* Setup of regular reports that provide insight into ongoing company/departmental performance.<br />* Assisting with online ad creative endeavours, their implementation and analysing their impact<br /><br />Once you have proven yourself you will have great freedom and autonomy, coupled with an enormous opportunity for personal development. All of our roles are remote working roles, however for London based team members<br />there is the ability to co-work as well. We live for our mission, but like to have fun along the way!<br /><br />*IS THIS YOU?*<br /><br />Our ideal candidate will first and foremost be as passionate about our mission as we are! In addition to this, you will have the following experience and skills:<br /><br />* Significant prior experience with SQL and RDBMS.<br />* Experience with Web Development and Visualization Tools, preferably with experience of relevant<br />JavaScript libraries (such as D3, jQuery, Bootstrap) and knowledge web models (e.g. LAMP)<br />* Experience of image processing software (e.g. Photoshop/GIMP)<br />* Excitement about Productivity Tools and Data Science.<br />* Curiosity about and enthusiasm for systems and processes<br />* Scrappy and resourceful when facing challenges of all types<br />* An eye for detail<br /><br />*Bonus points:*<br /><br />* You have experience working for a high-growth startup<br />And all OLIO team members share these attributes:<br />* A self-starter with a ‘can-do’ attitude<br />* Resourceful and creative<br />* Thorough, but able to move quickly and decisively<br />* A ruthless ability to prioritise<br />* Excellent communication skills<br />* Fun to work with :)"

We are a growing team of 6 people with plans to expand rapidly by the end of 2018.<br><br>With multiple new product launches on the horizon and several more planned before the end of the year, you will be joining the company at a time of explosive growth. Your presence will have a very real impact on the company’s value.<br><br>We are looking for a **Backend Web Developer** to join our tech team’s efforts to **supercharge our PHP web application**. You will be working directly with Pierre-Camille, our founder, who developed the original product from scratch, as well as with all members of the tech, marketing, and success teams.<br><br>Our company is fully distributed and remote. We believe and fully embrace that your best environment is wherever you - personally - feel the most productive and comfortable for day-to-day work. Nevertheless, we organise frequent meetups and retreats for the team to physically meet throughout the year. The last two trips were to Lisbon/Cascais and Paris!<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>**⭐️ What you will do: ⭐️**<br><br>• You will be an **architect**: planning structural masterpieces, laying foundations, building pillars, and reinforcing walls. Maybe a statue here and there...<br><br>• You will be **in charge of drastically improving** multiple features for our web app, helping to developing new product lines, as well as improving and maintaining the quality of the entire codebase.<br><br>• You will be **a leader in performance** (logic optimisation, indexes, queries, caching), **security** (discovering and plugging vulnerabilities), and **code health** (refactoring, unit and integration testing).<br><br>• You will **take charge of your own work** and proactively suggest improvements across the whole backend.<br><br>• In a remote environment you will be **responsible for your own time and results** – there will be no babysitting.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>**✅ What you will need to succeed: ✅**<br><br>• **Nutcracker**: you love solving engineering problems.<br><br>• **Independent**: you are self-motivated, take initiative, and are a strong communicator. You are results-driven and willing to learn and improve yourself.<br><br>• **Technical Ninja**: proficiency with PHP 7.0+, Laravel 5.2+, MySQL, Git, beanstalkd, and Memcached and/or Redis, backed by 5+ years of Backend development experience.<br><br>• **Design Pattern Jedi**: great knowledge of and direct experience with multiple design patterns. You have written superbly abstracted code and accompanying unit tests from scratch. You have also refactored legacy, non-testable code into something less apocalyptic.<br><br>• **Caring Developer**: you recognise that your code and work impact not only the customers but also the rest of the team. You conduct yourself with professionalism and respect not only in meetings but also in how you structure your code and in the documentation that you write.<br><br>• **Superb English fluency**: we are an international team and clear communication is vital. It goes without saying (but we’ll say it anyway) that you absolutely must have the ability to participate in frequent video meetings.<br><br>• The product team is based in Europe, so at the moment we are looking for developers who are based within the same general time zones (UTC±3).<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>** Brownie points: **<br><br>• You have experience with Continuous Integration using Travis, Circle, Gitlab, or Bitbucket.<br><br>• Interactive Git rebasing doesn’t sound like voodoo to you.<br><br>• You’ve used in Git commit messages.<br><br>• You have experience with Machine Learning either with off-the-shelf tools like Dialog Flow or - better yet - more low level using tools and platforms like Theano, Torch, and Google/AWS/Microsoft/IBM ML stacks.<br><br>• You’ve built a Node.JS backend or API.<br><br>• You see past the glossy veneer of the ‘microservices’ buzzword and know when and how to build them.<br><br>**(Let us know how many  you deserve.)**<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>** What we offer: **<br><br>• Competitive salary, including the possibility of stock options.<br><br>• Ample paid leave, in addition to maternity and paternity leave.<br><br>• A great support structure: we are here for you.<br><br>• Flexible contract. You will work independently where you are most productive and happiest, with flexible weekday hours.<br><br>• All the resources and tools that you need to succeed<br><br>• Join a fast-growing startup and be part of the force that shapes the company in the years to come!<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>We are solving global short-term rental automation. **Are you in?**<p>See more jobs at <span>Smartbnb</span></p><p>Visit <a href='https://landing.smartbnb.io/messaging' rel='nofollow'>Smartbnb</a>'s website</p></div></div>"

    "content": "<br />The company<br /><br />Prolific (www.prolific.ac) brings people together to power the world’s research. It is the first scientific, highly scalable, ethical participant recruitment platform for researchers around the world. Quantitative and qualitative researchers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs all need valid and reliable data sources to make predictions about human behaviour, social change, and global developments. Thanks to our online platform, researchers collect responses fast and participants earn cash rewards for themselves or for charity. It takes 5 minutes to start data collection, there's no middleman, and the product easily integrates with any survey software. In a world of unreliable results, Prolific makes data trustworthy and connects the public with science.<br /><br />The role<br /><br />In this role you will develop and implement data analyses, data collection systems, and other strategies that help us better understand user behaviour as well as our business and product performance. You will be analysing data using statistical techniques with a focus on understanding our growth engine, users’ full life cycle, data quality, and user demographics (for representative sampling): How does Prolific currently acquire, convert, and retain its users (both Researchers and Participants)? And what can be done to improve user acquisition, conversion, and retention? What are the current demographics of the pool, and what differences are there to the general population? Which participants are the most honest and engaged, and which are not?<br /><br />You will have an opportunity to learn about the startup ecosystem, about the lean startup approach, and about user acquisition techniques and growth strategies. More broadly, you will get the chance to learn about business and product development, data science, and diverse research areas in the social and natural sciences.<br /><br />This is your chance to get involved in a fast-moving startup where you’ll have huge influence over the trajectory of the product. Since it’s a startup, you’ll have the opportunity to suggest how you can best add value, and make any recommendations about improving the processes and product. We're a fast-growing company and we want to help you grow with us.<br /><br />Working closely with our analysis team, developers and leadership you will work towards these key goals:<br /><br />Analyse what drives the growth of our platform and what is the best allocation of resources in order to improve this growth<br />Improve the quality, the honesty, and engagement of Prolific’s participant pool through analysis of user behaviour and collection of new data<br />Improve the diversity and representativeness of Prolific’s participant pool by ongoing monitoring of demographics<br />This will likely involve some or all of the following:<br /><br />Analyse key growth metrics, retention, stickiness, churn over time and determine causal links between product changes and growth. Work closely with management and use these data to influence key decisions and help our startup grow quickly<br />Use analytics software such as Amplitude to create visualisations, segment our user base, and develop dashboards to track key growth, data quality, and demographic metrics over time<br />Develop a clear understanding of our community and intersect this qualitative data with quantitative data and develop a plan of key questions to answer with data<br />Extract data from non-SQL/SQL databases for analyses in a reproducible way for downstream analysis or work closely with developers in order to achieve this<br />Statistically analyse large data sets (millions of rows) and draw robust conclusions from these data with the understanding that large data sets are messy, and it is easy to draw incorrect conclusions from these data if our analyses are not robust<br />Develop attention checks, consistency checks and longitudinal measures designed to track participants’ consistency, honesty, and engagement<br />Proactively suggest new questions to ask, new data to collect, or product changes to make based on insights from data<br />Generate regular reports in a reproducible manner which clearly and accurately describe the collection, organisation, and analysis of your data<br />Disseminate the key information to the whole organisation in written reports and summaries, which highlight the key insights you’ve gained and which are easily interpretable and actionable<br />Benefits<br /><br />Salary: £28,000-32,000 (p.a.), negotiable based on experience and qualifications, plus:<br />Pension (employer contribution 3% of base salary)<br />Flexible working: Work equipment of your choice, you can work flexibly from home or from our coworking space, flexible hours<br />25 days holiday per year, plus bank holidays<br />Flexible budget for any books and/or educational material<br />Personal growth opportunities (e.g., learn about the startup ecosystem, mentoring from executive team, learn about psychological science and research methods)<br />Open, transparent, and inclusive culture<br />Self-made cider and home-baked cookies :-)<br />How we interview & hire<br /><br />Our hiring process usually begins with an introductory online interview to help you get to know us better, and vice versa. At this stage, we would like to better understand your motivation for the role, get to know about your interests and personality, and learn about any relevant past experience or skills you might have. If this initial interview is successful, we'd then invite you to complete an assignment ("

Whether you have worked primarily in SQL Server, Postgres or something else, we only ask that you have a strong understanding of building data pipelines and can apply your skills within our fast-paced and agile approach.</p><p>While some companies may hide their data engineers away in some dungeon, data engineers at InterWorks are social, friendly creatures.

Making mistakes in our business has direct effects on our clients' customers. We take both of these facts very seriously. At odds with this, Simon embraces the startup ethos of keeping lean and focused. We move quickly (continuous deployment) and emphasize experimentation to test hypotheses. To help us keep a high bar of quality, you'll bring a mindset for creativity and fault tolerance to your work every day.</p><p>Simon's engineering team is distributed across four states; we welcome engineers working at our New York City offices as well as remote employees.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability.</p><p>We'd love to meet you and learn more about your career goals.</p></div>"

    "content": "*ABOUT US*<br /><br />Do you want to build an exciting new brand in an industry ripe for a makeover?<br /><br />Join us on our mission.<br /><br />At Laka, we believe that traditional insurance fails to offer peace of mind. It’s an inconvenience people have to deal with – unpleasant, expensive and unfair. <br /><br />Laka has a new way to protect your favourite things in the world.<br /><br />What makes us truly different is that members of our community don’t pay a fixed premium every year, but only share the true cost of claims incurred by the community. Simple, but truly disruptive (Sorry for the D-word).<br /><br />The first thing we have chosen to insure are high-end bicycles. For that, we have assembled a community of real cyclists who protect each other's bikes against whatever happens. <br /><br />Every month Laka helps community members in need - when their gear is damaged or stolen. At the end of the month, all costs are split between the community, but each member’s premium is capped at market rate. Instead of paying hefty margins, our customers know they will always get the best price for great cover. <br /><br />Insurance that just works.<br /><br />We went from concept to regulated business with a live product in 12 months. On the way, we joined fantastic ecosystems such as Anthemis’ Fellowship program and  Startupbootcamp InsurTech, gathering a stellar host of business angels around us. <br /><br />You can be an integral part of the brilliant team taking the business from hundreds to thousands of customers. With our revolutionary approach to insurance, we have the opportunity to relentlessly challenge the status quo in insurance and build a brand which truly reflects our mission.  <br /><br />We’re currently a team of 7, so everyone is vitally important to our success. You’ll be working directly with the company founders and will get to experience life in a startup company as we scale! We encourage you to get involved with any aspect of the business you are interested in. T-shaped people are the best! <br /><br />Our office is in Oxford Circus, but we are flexible and understand sometimes you just need to work from home or wherever inspires you the most.<br /><br />The specifics (including the final title) of the role will vary depending on your experience, but in any case, it will grow with you. We want bright people to join us on our journey.<br /><br />*ABOUT YOU*<br /><br />Ideally, you can hit the ground running, have an interest in learning new things, and are comfortable working in a (constantly!) changing environment.<br /><br />You have an eye for design, and like to use this in solving both real world and technical problems. You are familiar with (at least some of) our current front-end stack: Javascript (ES6), React, Redux, GraphQL. <br />Most importantly you should be well versed with idiosyncrasies of HTML/CSS.<br /> <br />You have exposure to Git, and have worked in an agile environment. <br /><br />You must have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />*BONUS POINTS*<br /><br />- Full-stack or backend development experience (Node.js, MySQL, AWS). <br />- Experience designing/building Native mobile apps.<br />- Experience with (or interest in) AI and machine learning or data visualisation would be a plus (our internal systems are based on data science/ML processes).<br />- A passion for cycling!<br /><br />*OUR OFFER*<br /><br />- £20-50k annual salary (dependent on experience)<br />- Stock options: level depending on experience and expertise<br />- Flexible Holiday Policy<br />- Great working environment either in a Shared office space near Oxford Circus or a New Location in Bristol<br />- Flexible work arrangements: as long as the work gets done<br />- Generous Conference/Training budget<br />- Child-care vouchers<br />- Cycle to work scheme<br />- Regular team off-sites to collectively decide our future<br />- Weekly team lunch<br /><br />Above all: an opportunity to make a real impact in an archaic industry<br /><br />*THE PROCESS*<br /><br />We aim to reply to all applicants within a week of receiving your application. Our interview process will have of several stages, each allowing us getting to know you better, professionally and technically - and for you to understand our culture and ethos. <br /><br />The stages include: <br />-    CV and code sample/portfolio review<br />-    Coding Test<br />-    Phone / Video interview<br />-    Face to Face interview<br /><br />We hope to get all the above done within 2-3 weeks, depending on your availability and convenience."
